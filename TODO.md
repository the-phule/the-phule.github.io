iccubi - make a note taking function so the bot will except message for users and then spit them out with a decent list in p/m. Some thing like 

<me> _icuubi_ remindme blah blah foo foo...
<bot> _me_ i'll remember that for you!

at some later date:

<me> _icuubi_ tellme

in private message:
<bot> your reminders are:
<bot> 1. blah foo
<bot> 2. blah blah foo foo...
<bot> 3. something else to remember

could probably make it spit back the number associated with the message, so you could reprint it on its own, ie.

<me> _icuubi_ tellme 1
in private message:
<bot> your reminders are:
<bot> 1. blah foo
