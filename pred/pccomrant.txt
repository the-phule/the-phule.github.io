Subject: the big compile


Ok, so I'm slugging away trying to get this serial card goin' in Pesky.

I added a new network card (smc-ultra) at irq=10 io=0x300 and set to
pay no attention to a rom (this is why it didnt work in the windows
machine Simon!).
 insmod 8390.o 
then
 insmod smc-ultra io=0x300 irq=10
coughs the appropriate MAC, I tell it 
 ifconfig eth0 203.57.122.73 up 
and hence I can talk to feral and ftp the pccomlinux.zip over to pesky
where I unzipped it. Here's some excerpts from the readme.

>>> Default Configuration of PCCOM 4/8-Port cards in the LINUX system <<<

>   The first 8-Port card setting is

>    I/O base address = 0x100
>    IRQ              = selectable if it is not used by others
>    device node      = ttyS16 - ttyS23, cua16 - cua23

Yeah, sure, if only ye manual wouldst tell us what the switch settings
are for base IO addresses on this thing. I think there isnt an IRQ
conflict anyway.

> Install the Decision PCCOM 4/8-Port Driver into LINUX <<<

It says nothing about pluggin' it into the motherboard. I did that anyway
8-). Booted up:

> 1. Login as a root user.

(yeah, I can do that)

Doesnt say anything about where to shove all the blah.c and blah.h files
which appear when the pccomlinux.zip file is uncompressed.

> 2. Build the LINUX kernel with the Decision PCCOM 8-Port Driver.
> 2.1. # cd /usr/src/linux

Ok

>   2.2. # make config
>       When the following prompt messages displayed,

>          Standard/generic serial support? (CONFIG_SERIAL) [N/y/m/?] Y
                                                                 |
                                                       enter 'Y' +

Fark! there's only about oh, seven million messages displayed, mainly, do
you want kernel support for your intergalactic long range probe, vegetable
pulverizer, illudium Q37 explosive space modulator, infrared remote
controller and pet hamster automatic
self-destruct interface... I tell it I want 

dumb serial support 
support for consoles on serial ports 
extended dumb serial driver options 
support more than 4 serial ports 
support for sharing serial interrupts 
that it DOES NOT autodetect irq on standard ports
support special multiport boards
nonstandard serial port support

M (module?) support for a whole range of cards I dont have
stallion multiport support...

and defaults for about three thousand other things, including a weirdo
NCR53C400 trantor scsi card which I'm trying to get to talk to a texel
scsi cdrom we have inherited. Dreeeam on.


>   2.3. # make depend

I do a make dep. The load average goes up and Linux figures out what stuff
needs what stuff. Pisses messages everywhere for five minutes. Then I

>   2.4. # make zlilo

the Gnu C compiler and assembler and linker and a few other things swing
into action making lots of messages happen as it compiles lots of little
bits of stuff into executable code. I guess it knows where to look for
stuff for kernel recompile? Naaah. This takes, on Pesky, a 20Mb of ram,
486-100 with a green heatsink saying it's a Cyrix 5x86-100GP, a looong
time.

While this happens I trawl around in the zip. It appears there's a file
called serial.c which is the modified version of the serial driver code
which I discovered in /usr/src/linux/drivers/char (serial devices squirt
ascii characters around, so they're classified as character devices).

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it would be a good idea to replace
the existing /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/serial.c with the one from the
uncompressed archive? Hmmm. I suspect this makes all of this huugge
compile a waste of time since the updates didnt get included. Great
instructions, missing all those important bits. Or maybe it's just my
frontal lobe.

Part two tomorrow. Ill set up the compile on pesky with serial.c replaced
by the downloaded one, and go do something else for a few hours 8-)
