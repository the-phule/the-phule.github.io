Hi Predator

You have sent another email,
I have moved it over into the trash before reading 
and I will not bother to read any more of your rubbish
you had 2 chances to write a correct email,
no more chances, sorry, 
any more emails from you will result in this email
being returned to you every time, we just do not 
have time to read unnamed nonsense, take a hike.

In future send snail mail, or if you are in Sydney telephone
but no more emails will be bothered, ever from predator

send a snail mail with your correct name
and a copy of this email before any more dialog emails
will be considered, and after that include your name affixed
