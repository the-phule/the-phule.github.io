So to be decodable the cipher has to be a Fano code. AND no letter starts
with an 0 (very helpful). The problem is not merely one of decoding the
letters, but matching their frame as well, which is a pain in the arse,
though it helps that all frames commence with a 1. If it's English,
the frame length of one letter might bear some resemblance to the likely
frame length of another. Most common letter: S, 10011. Longest run of 0's
is O. Longest run of 0's is p. Surprised they were all five letters long,
which also helped.
