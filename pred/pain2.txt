Hi,

trafshow reveals that udp in the form of DNS queries is the most
traffic..

We want to serve our master zones but not let everybody lookup arbitrary
DNS records through ollie i believe..

Requires configuring BIND to be more restrictive i reckon


I stopped bind, netatalk, postfix    (/etc/init.d/ scripts..)  


also i suspected and noticed that from the woody upgrade the bind script
was changed (cf /etc/init.d/bind & /etc/init.d/bind.dpkg-old ) and we
lost the customisations (chroot 'ing bind into /home/named.) So i edited
/etc/init.d/bind and restarted

No more time now sorry .....


More experienced DNS configurers may like to comment on this??

  -r          Turns recursion off in the server.  Answers can come only
  from local (primary or secondary) zones.  This can be used on root
servers.  The default is to use recursion.


This (recursion) is currently on - should it be off? What is the
implications?
