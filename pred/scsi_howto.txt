Recommended procedure is to do:

1. Look in /boot/module_info to work out what params the aha152x module
might want.

...
aha152x
        scsi_hostadapter
        "Adaptec AHA-152x host adapter driver"
        aha152x "First adaptor: ioport, irq, scsiid, reconnect, parity,
synchronous, delay" "0x[0-9a-fA-F]+.*"
        aha152x1 "Second adaptor: ioport, irq, scsiid, reconnect, parity,
synchronous, delay" "0x[0-9a-fA-F]+.*"
...

2. Look in aha152x for likely values to set those params to:

...
 IOPORT        base io address                           (0x340/0x140)
 IRQ           interrupt level                           (9-12; default
11)
 SCSI_ID       scsi id of controller                     (0-7; default 7)
 RECONNECT     allow targets to disconnect from the bus  (0/1; default 1
[on])
 PARITY        enable parity checking                    (0/1; default 1
[on])
 SYNCHRONOUS   enable synchronous transfers              (0/1; default 0
[off])
 (NOT WORKING YET)
 DELAY:        bus reset delay                           (default 100)
 EXT_TRANS:    enable extended translation               (0/1: default 0
[off])
 (see NOTES below)

....

3. See if the driver will load with no args:

modprobe aha152x

4. If that didn't work (it might, there is an AUTOCONF option in the
driver), let's try with an I/O port:

sudo /sbin/modprobe aha152x ioport=0x340

5. Iterate 4 with various likely I/O, IRQ settings.

6. If the module loads without complaint, see if there are any SCSI
devices detected:

cat /proc/scsi/scsi

7. Tranfer required ioport, irq settings to /etc/modules.conf.

8. Be happy.

Good luck!
