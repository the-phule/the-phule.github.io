> Very, very sorry to have upset you.

Well, for fuck's sake, pay attention to what it was that upset me and
don't do it to anyone else.

YES. Do you think I was JOKING?

And then YOU GO ON AND DO EXACTLY WHAT I SAID I WOULD KILLFILE YOU FOR.

You're NOT LEARNING ARE YOU? 

 
> You mention you were stoned while writing.

Wasn't. I'm blissfully happy when stoned. I was infuriated when I wrote
what you just got. 


> I'd like to reply in point form to several things, but won't,
> unless you let me.


You imply that you want to ask permission, after I told you not to reply
in the previous email and then you go AND REPLY ANYWAY in this one.
GRAAAAH@#%^@#$&#& DOESNT GET IT DOES HE??!?! Stupid, stupid,
context-broken cunt!



> So many misunderstandings...

Complete the following proverb: When in a hole... 


> In the meantime, a more general reply, though still risking
> excommunication by replying at all:

Risk implies uncertainty. What part of "Reply to this AND I'll lock you
out" don't you understand? It's a boolean fucking operator! A TRANSISTOR
PAIR can do it. 

  

> I'd never have even drempt of trying to read your messages.

This, coming from someone who's just crowed to me about how fuckin' smart
he is for _deducing_ their contents without reading them, is just so
insanely hypocritical that it almost defies belief. You don't need to read
them you just read me, deduce what you want, then tell me. 


> Yes, I guessed Xiu was involved somehow. So what?

So what? SO WHAT?!?! YOU JUST DON'T GET IT DO YOU?

The idea is to KEEP IT TO YOUR FUCKING SELF.


> Thats not 'prying' thats just an intuition, which simply happens.

Oh, that's self-delusional utter bullshit Guy. Don't you fucking
understand this? You listed the whole source code for your deduction in a
previous email. You voiced the intuition. Why? To deduce my by body
language reaction as to the state of the truth of your intuition.

WAKE UP DICKHEAD: _THAT_ IS PRYING. DONT YOU FUCKING UNDERSTAND THAT?




> But no, didn't think it was any of my business, and only
> wished you well. Knew you wouldn't want to talk about it,
> I didn't either, except to let _you_ know I was happy about it.

Guy extracts information from my reactions, against my wishes, then writes
me an email after I've blasted him for doing so, failing to then see that
emailing an additional paragraph wherein he then says he was doing it to
VOICE AN OPINION ABOUT WHAT HE'D DEDUCED ABOUT MY PRIVATE LIFE... 

I DIDN'T WANT TO FUCKING KNOW AT ALL WHAT YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT MY
MESSAGES.


 
> At the time, I only made two brief comments re the SMS,
> and neither were meant in a hostile sense. Neither were questions,
> neither requesting any answer.


This is self-rationalisational sophistry and you know it. You made the
statements, got a reaction then wrote a fucking email to me with a
categorical list of things you were looking for to GAUGE WETHER OR NOT
YOUR STATEMENT WAS CORRECT. Were you a detective in a past life?

Are you the sort of chap who'd go to court and try the following defense 
"I only raped her a little bit, your honour."



> The 'I know who that was' was meant to be 'friendly-teasing' and also
> (by sounding happy) to let you know I didn't mind at all _if_ it was
> Xiu.

Well, fuck me, you didn't at all forsee the background context at all did
you? Did your body language tutorials tell you how to deduce that
too? Not.


> It was deliberately low information content, so as not to complicate
> anything with your parents. Yes, I did think about that.

One bit can change the world. It has.


> Can you suggest a better way I could say 'its OK, if its Xiu',
> given situation constraints? 


YES: BE SILENT! SHUUUUUT THE FUUUUUCK UUUUUUUP!  DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
YOUR APPROVAL OF WHOM I FUCK, REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE, IS NOT FUCKING
WANTED?!??! HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THAT? HOW MANY WAYS ARE THERE
TO SAY IT?


> Are you still going to be mad at me
> for just trying to let you know I didn't mind if it was her?


YES. What you think of my relationship to her is absolutely irrelevant to
my anger. _THAT_ you were thinking about it, would subtly extract
reactions from me about it, and that you would voice opinions about it, in
front of my oldies... I mean, why don'tya just take a shit on the carpet
too?


> The "if that was Xiu, have a good time" was exactly what it said.

Take any ten people and individually tell them in your best voice that you
have deduced from their body language that they're gonna get laid and
you hope they enjoy screwing their partners tonight. When you get out of
hospital, consider why you got there. If you make it out at all. 


> Best wishes. Neither interrogation, or insinuation, or anything
> hostile. Friend, saying 'have a good time/evening/whatever' by

...Friend asking, very carefully, are you gonna screw my ex...

YOU CONTINUE TO DELUDE YOURSELF THAT YOU EXTRACTED NO INFORMATION FROM ME,
EVEN AFTER YOU WROTE ME AN EMAIL SAYING YOU DID, AND HOW YOU DID IT.
AN IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR BRAIN IS BROKEN, GUY!


> Due to bad hearing, and distance, and background noise, 

All of which are irrelevant to your categorised VISUAL assessment of my
response... and you KNOW IT. Stop trying to wriggle out of it. YOU FUCKED
UP AND ARE FUCKING UP MORE BY TRYING TO DENY IT.  Do you think I'm
screaming at you because I think you're RIGHT?


I'm NOT getting paid to teach you how to have a clue about human
relationships.

If you hadn't gone bragging to me about it later in the previous email, I
might have forgotten about it. But noooo. Hadda bask in your own triumph.

"Cuntstable, I wobbed dah bank! I'm so pwoud of mahself. Here's how ah
diddit, ain't I smart, duh p'lice didn't catch me, haw haw!"
 

> As for expecting me to to not even think about Xiu, or hope for news
> of her - thats unfair, unkind, and unrealistic.

I know. JUST DON'T DO IT IN FRONT OF ME, WHILE YOU'RE CLAIMING I'M GONNA
SHAG HER. 

Ah, fuck it, go right ahead. Too late anyway.


> I'm in love with her, wish I wasn't, know its stupid, but can't do
> anything about it except just wait for the pain to go away.

YES THERE IS. LEAVE HER ALONE.

Thank you for not being jealous.

Yes. You don't give a shit, but will pry and blab anyway. Are you not in
control of yourself... dy'a hang around outside her house and stalk her,
send her unwanted emails, SMSs, fone calls, letters, and claim that 
you're helpless and can't help yourself? No, don't answer that. I
don't want to know. I WANT YOU TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS OF YOURSELF.

FUCK WHAT YOU HAPPEN TO INCORRECTLY THINK IS UNJUSTIFIED. That you are
CONVINCED that you've made no mistakes is what's stopping you from
learning that you have.
 

Is it not perfectly lucid that I am LIVID about this?

YES. SO WHY THE FUCK DID YOU DO IT?

NYAAARGGGH! I /DIDN'T/ ASK FOR YOUR OPINION ON WHAT I WAS GONNA SHAG ON
SUNDAY NIGHT, FUCK YOU! YOU TOLD ME ANYWAY!
 
You can go and be unsolicitedly, dangerously honest about someone fuckin'
else now. Fuck off.

> There are so many things in that email I'd like to reply to directly.

Too late.

> May we continue?

Don't ask. You are not listening to the answers.


> Or was this too much already?

What does your intuition tell you? It if tells you no, you're WRONG.

 
> Guy
> 
> 
> Btw, if you feel you need someone to rage at, go ahead. 

I am not raging at anyone else. This is quite specific to you. I didn't
feel the need to rage at you until your previous email. This is completely
irrelevant to how I feel about dying. Though you'll convince yourself that
it isn't.

> I won't let it affect my respect and friendship for you.

You have mistaken me for someone who gives a shit what you presently think
of them. 


> You'll get a lot of emotional swings, no matter how hard you try to be
> coldly rational about your troubles.

I expected you to say that. Look up condecension in the dictionary
sometime, will you? Thanks for the fatherly advice, Dad. My spamfilter
will be coldly rational about this matter on my behalf.

 
> I promise I won't get offended.
> I'll be here, OK?


I'll pop your books around next opportunity I get. If I see you, say
NOTHING. Do NOT WRITE ME A LETTER LATER ABOUT MY BODY LANGUAGE WHEN I DROP
THE BOOKS OFF, OR WHAT YOU DEDUCE FROM IT. I do not want to fucking KNOW.


> I may not be very good at being a friend, but I will do what I can.

The best thing you can do for the forseeable future is SHUT UP! 
 

> And yes, I'll read your email again, and learn what I can.

Too late. Play with the entrails all you like, it obviously won't help
you.


> Looking forward to continuing that conversation, if you can spare the time.




Congratulations. Incoming mail from you will go to /dev/null for ever.
