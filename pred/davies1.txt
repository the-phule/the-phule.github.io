Um... try knoppix3.2. It autodetects everything, runs in RAM, writes nothing to
harddisk. Get a second machine (old pootas are cheap!) and use it as a sandpit.
Dude... back up your files anyway you can! Zip 'em up and ftp 'em someplace.
File loss sux.

Training kids to use MS is a free payment to Microsoft since it makes them
depend on MS products later. And hamstrings them for all sorts of reasons.

Cool. I noticed on Slashdot this is happening across Europe in general. Good!

Ooooh, don't I know that from bitter experience. But then I spend a third of my
life asleep. It's like this: the existing hires (who know MS) decide what OSs
they'll use. They protect their own investment in what OS they know about.

Yeah. But it occurred to me as a possibility... Joss wasn't using secure email
and hubbys have snooped on their wives mail since time immemorial. I thought,
arr, fuck it, let whatever eyes seek them see them. And so they did. Most are
not prepared for what they discover.

If I was really sneaky, I'd have suggested to Joss via some other route that the
surveilled email be salted so we could massage your thinking and opinions in
particular ways. But I'm not naturally sneaky and I suspect she isn't either. It's
simpler to be honest.

>The reason for prying, let's name that action, is two-fold. On the one side it's
>insecurity and on the other self-protection.

Yep. I'd probably do the same if I were you, and if I were in your situation.
I think you have the motivations correct tho.

Yep too. That's a funny thing about truth. It has a way of corroding holes in
the things which attempt to contain it.

Ok.



>Now you could interpret that as saying she lied; however, we both acknowledge

Yeah dude. I suspect if Joss was keeping stumm on her involvement with me it was 
because she thought she could prevent you being needlessly burnt by it.

I know. That's one of the things we love her for 8-)

I couldn't tell her to make any particular call on that - not my advice to give.
I figured she'd reveal whatever she thought she needed to.

It's complicated to understand but it's simplest I think to just assume
everyone's gonna fuck up and just be prepared to forgive 'em. Sounds easy but
rips yer guts out in the execution. Must have peeled the paint off the walls
when you and she were doing the inevitable screamin' match about this. Ow. 

Love is the worst position from which to make a rational decision about
anything, but it's surprising how much - the courses of entire lives -is decided
whilst one is within its influence.

Arrr... man. I can't help you with any of that. I'm not especially well sorted
out m'self, really. I'm not sure Joss is entirely sorted out either, or even if
it's reasonable to assume that she ever will be. Some of us never get sorted.

Heh. Nah. And - thanks for going to the effort of writing all of this stuff, it
means I get to know a lot more about who you are and what you and joss are
dealing with.

Rightio. How's she goin' these days anyway? Ya keep in contact?

Yeah. Experience is a hellish teacher. Having a kid is not the emotionally
optimal way to end a relationship, tho it helps one propagate one's genes, and
it takes two to tango.

It is evolved for self-perpetuation, which is different. Dude... why did you
both have a kid anyhow if you knew what a pain in the arse it could be and ya
knew (if you did know) you were gonna scarper? I'm an accident myself, so don't
be afraid to tell me if Evie was. It's none of my business really anyway, so you
don't even have to answer. Just innerested, and all.

Fair enough. Normality *is* depressing. Make no mistake. Abnormality is

Pre-eclampsia... yeah. Another un-delightful bit of human genetic heritage. Do
check out some of the BJOG (Brit. J. of Gynae) articles on it. Mainly thought to
accrue from long-term free radical damage, correlates with dodgy genes for
controlling reactive oxygen species.

Nobody can answer this. But if you had to go, you had to go. That's how it is.
Genes keep us on a very tight leash. Reproduce, run away, reproduce somewhere
else is a strategem so old it predates mammalia.

Biology doesn't care a rats for any of this anguish you're going through. It's
simpler to just drop it if you can.

Naturally, they do, as does just about everyone with a load o' $. Money is a
quantified unit of decision-making power.

Hmmm. Nope. I have early memories of my adoptive mum asleep on the kitchen

that.

Yeah. Tricky though. I think the thing is to not remain mutually damaged, but to

I know. I think, though, that if lies didn't serve some purpose, we wouldn't
exhibit the ability to tell them. We all lie, we all hide the truth. I'm
surprised we don't expect it more often.

>I'm sorry your own feelings got hurt in all this and I wish I could have been

As kind as it is to hear apologies I am not expecting them and they're really
not necessary, though yeah, it was pretty sad meeting her again after going to
the effort of consigning her to my history. As I recall it, and Joss might
correct me if I'm deluding myself, we just came to a conclusion that she wasn't
then in a position to independantly decide what to do, so off she went back to
England wondering what might happen when she got back. I didn't know you at all
back then. But I figured whoever you were, if you were important enough to Joss
that she'd marry ya, our making heavy decisions without you in the loop wouldn't
be respectful to you.

You foresaw correctly. Just as well, really.

Partnership difficulty increases proportionally to 2^n where n is the number of
others involved. 


>Anyway, enough for now. Perhaps I've managed to bore your 'Bill' to death!

Um, no. But you did lay a lotta heavy stuff on me there and it tooka lot of guts
to come out with it. Im not well equipped to deal with a lot of what you wrote
which is why there's a lot of shortish one-line comments among your slabs of
originating text. Sorry about that. 



I'm trying a new approach: eat so much chocolate that Bill overheats itself from
glucose overload and dies that way. Somethin' tells me it won't work, but ar,
