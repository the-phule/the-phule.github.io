Whoohoo, fully sick maaaate! I finish a stint o' work about then. We can
pretend to be affluent yuppies in Balmain coffee houses for a couple of
hours. Or ya can see my present digs, from which I am still to be avulsed.

Wow! From what sort of chips is the shop constructed - casino chips? Wood
chips? Silicon chips? Potato chips? Did you see a hundred different movies
or 100 instances of the same one (more economical, I find)? Do you have
your brain backed up on disk somewhere? Have you started *eating* dope
instead of wastefully heating it up and dumping it in the air when you
light it?

Well, it'll be fine once you've equilibrated, but you might be a bit cold

Good for you! Less paperwork to change, less de-individuation. Maybe you
can both change your last name to something totally outrageous, such as a
verb which lends itself to sentence completion... Jocelyn Was? Jocelyn
Will? Jocelyn Is? I'm sure you could concoct something amusing of this
sort.

I'd think not. I don't know the % absorbed in either case but I suspect
the hellish destructive temperatures in the cone, plus active ingredients
lost to smoke, you lose less by eating it; OTOH the absorbance rate is
slower when eaten. So you are probably right - eating's less wasteful, but
less profoundly noticable and thus less efficient, per gram.

I was perched up a very tall tree in Hyde park, hidden by camouflage
pants, except for my prominent "Kill Your TV" singlet. I could not see
road or grass in any direction, just lots of people. I saw Matt Arnison,
my conspiracy theorist engineer / drain exploring friend Guy, Ned from
Food not Bombs, one of my squatmates Kernow, and *lots of people my
parents age*... very unusual for a demo. I notice the traffic lights in
Sydney are now poster-resistant and harder to climb than the old wood
ones, and the cops still ask me to climb down off them.


> Let me know what you're up to and when you're free for a coffee. 

That'd be wicked! I'm at the Uni today, and in the midst of a flat patch
in my cashflow since the paymasters are bureaucratic and glacially
laggard- a refrain of which you've doubtless tired, but there it is. 
However, the dumpsters have been most bounteous and I am well
fed. ThreeFeet has gone belly-up, so I will point you in the direction of
a great place on Norton St Leichardt - Bar Italia, which if you've not
tried it yet you should. Whatcha reckon Wednesday this week? Have you a
time convenient?

I've become a fully fledged wanker and I have a mobile phone now. However
I use it so infrequently that I can't even remember what the number is so
I cannot pass it on, and usually I forget to charge the thing so it's
useless anyway and when it is charged it's in the bottom of my huge bag of
junk 8-)   So, best try email.

Definitely Nemesis, if you're amenable to it. I gather it was whinged

Weeeel, I dunno, the ponderings of how else my slice of the universe might

wonder what predisposes me to speculate so? The attractiveness of the

Keystroke-logging, fer-instance, which tends to happen on machines to
which the curious party has physical access (eg: aaron's machine). Works
well, cat has previously fallen prey to it.

When one has secrets to keep one must learn and practise the art. Remember
when ASIO wanted a little chat to me in May of 2001? They emailed me from
a hotmail account they acquired for only one instance of use, and never
used it again.

I'm out too, actually, but I should have my telling-bone with me, f'yer up

and see if talk is cheap(er) on a landline 8-)
