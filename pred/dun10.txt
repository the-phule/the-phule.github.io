Yeah.
And if it is true, you can kick me off too while you are at it.
Because otherwise you will get an incredible amount of shit from
me, you fascist stupid cowardly bastard.

Note that I'm being deliberately rude so you have a good excuse,
within the reference frame of your own delusions of rightfull
omnipotence.

How dare you sign yourself 'Mod', instead of Ogre - which is
who you are, right? Think anonymity makes your personal
rulings wise or unquestionable? Think you can hide from the
inevitable criticism?

Maybe its time to start another yahoo group, this time run
by someone who'll take an oath or something, that they won't
abuse the responsibility. That would be a shame to have to
do, since it would split the message archives.
Personally, given that past episode of historical message
deletions, your recent unilateral dismissal of the assistant
moderators, and now this demonstration of fascist thinking,
I think you are not suited to the job (that you are 'having
fun' mishandling.)

You should hand it over to someone else. I've got better
things to do with my time. But then, considering that the
job of 'Mod' should consist of doing nothing but ensuring the
subscriber list matches that on expobase, I'd be prepared to
do it if no one else volunteers. And I'd guarantee to never
give anyone any hassles based on personal likes or dislikes.
I may be rude, but I'm fair.


I am _SOOOO_ sick of superior twats who think they personally
are justified in ruling on who else is and isn't kosher for
this or that activity/right/access/fun. It was that attitude
that just fucked up what could have been the best location/expo
ever held.

MOD spelt backwards is DOM. And no one asked you to be one,
or gave you permission to be the arbiter of good taste and
freedom in Clan debate.

And while I'm 'whinging' again, for those who think the recent
carry-on was unreasonable, how would _you_ have liked to have
had some people try to tell you that _your_ friends were not
allowed to go on _your_ expo, to the location _you_ found?
An expo that would possibly be unrepeatable, so anyone not there
would miss out permanently.  Exluded for reasons that were
spiteful and ridiculous. And then expect you to lie to one
of those friends to cover up those people's bias. And then
abuse you, verge on threating violence, and sabotage the mission,
when you point out what a bunch of hypocrites they are.
Just lovely.

These people just happened to be the ones who were around at
the time, and accepted my invite to go check out some interesting
stuff I'd found prevously. I didn't mention the really good thing,
not to get their hopes up in case it was a dud. Then later, I
didn't go all fascist and insist the return expo was 'mine'.
Was happy to have the planning run as a co-op effort. Which was
no excuse for them to get dictatorial about the membership list.

I am still so pissed off. Only people who do eventually get to
see the location will understand how much.
