Subject: [catkore] Chasing bandwidth

Hi rent-a-geek people,
I am contacting you for cat@lyst who are hoping to search out some new 
possibilities for bandwidth sharing, possibly with the NCC.

Our net connection has been fairly skimpy since first the EMU Cafe and then its 
successor "Fluid" went out of business a few months ago. We had a "contra" deal
with them which gave us good and free access. 

We are not expecting to be so lucky again, but hope to be able to come up with 
a mutually beneficial proposal for a non-profit group such as the NCC. Maybe 
a shared DSL modem installation. 

We haven't raised this with them yet, but thought that since you've been 
supporting them technically we would check in with you for any ideas you may 
have about it, and in any case just to let you know what we are doing.

cheers,
hugh trevelyan, for cat.
