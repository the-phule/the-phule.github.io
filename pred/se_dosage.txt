Scientists generally _are_ nonbelievers, and although I KNOW the
pharmo/med industries are rotten with false cures and vested interests,
at least, if one digs for long enough, one can find this corruption
out. I'll ask Ian fer references to articles upon which I can bring my
own possibly foggy judgement to bear - foggy because after all I have a
vested interest in the stuff working.

Martindales has not bullshitted to me previously in any way I could
detect, but there's always a first time. Entries in there also correlate
to entries in mah Merck index (several j. tox articles, which I have yet
to look up).

Nobody ever suggested to me that I should tweak my dosage according to my
body mass to get a rough dose/kg. I'm several kg less than yer average
adult male, fer instance, so per cell, if the distribution is uniform (not
likely) I'm copping somewhat more than the average male would require.
Since the distribution is not uniform, some tissues with low metabolic
turnover are getting less than the per-cell RDA, and it follows that some
tissues are getting a lot more (hopefully the tumors). I dunno what the
excretion of the material is like, so I think I should go check out the
pharmacokinetics of the element and the two aa's to which it usually finds
itself complexed.

What I want to ask is, how exactly was the 300ug/24h figure arrived at?

Call me a weirdo but I generally find biology calls for dosages which are
NOT neato powers of ten... for 300 I'd usually expect to see raw
requirement data numbers like 259ug or 307ug or something like that, +/-
some measurement error. 300 micrograms (in my body with a measured mass
of say, sixty five thousand million million micrograms, approximately)
smells to me like a noisy approximation, though I'm damn well aware that
300ug is a hell of a lot of selenium atoms:

Se Atomic weight 78.9
Avogadro's number 6.023x10^23, 
300ug is about 2.26x10^18 Se atoms.

The max possible number of enzymes with *one* selenocysteine or
selenomethionine in it, able to be synthesised from this mass of Se, is 
2.26 x 10^18. If Se-containing enzymes contain more than one Se then
divide by some co-efficient we don't know.

A 70kg man on average has about 30kg of cells which are actually
mammalian, metabolically active, doing respiration and stuff. The rest of
yer body mass is, eg, intercellular water, loads of microbes in e.g. yer
gut, and non-cell material like dentine, bone, keratin, etc. 3.5 trillion
cells (3.5x10^12 cells, a trillion is a thousand thousand thousand
thousand) I care about. I'd figure this out volumetrically at an average
of 1.25x10^8 cells/cc but I dont know what my volume is 'cos I have large
spaces (lungs) and much of my volume is cells other than me.

So roughly I have about 10^12 cells I care about, and 10^18 selenium atoms
which I throw at the system a day. This =>10^6 Se atoms per cell (cells
average 10ng), very roughly - shitloads in an enzymatic system. Cellular
[Se] never get that high 'cos the gut organisms will steal a lot of it,
and a stack will be excreted anyway. I still dunno how to figure out this
RDA stuff yet since I dunno the Se turnover.

Se's rare and forage-expensive to procure, so it follows that bodies will
likely have mechanisms to try to recycle it if they can.
