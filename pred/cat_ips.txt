Subject: diesel changed

Sat 9am - 11am

diesel has been moved from the tpg line to the attech line, and is now
hanging off tarvat in tarvat's dmz. 

I updated the records on easydns, so that the following now point to
202.52.33.193: diesel, ns, dns, black, fat, ollie (last a bit weird, as
ollie is actually now on warehouse lan, serving samba, ip is
192.168.121.2). This also has the effect of updating these aliases to
point to 202.52.33.193: proxy, cache, dialup, catdial

I updated the named.conf settings on diesel, setup new reverse zone
db.33.52.202.

Andy: please check the named.conf on colourful, put in new reverse zone.
Same for others who are acting as NS's for us.

I checked the log /var/log/named.out; errors caused when we try to
transfer zones from:
    203.15.106.21 (spinach)
    206.168.174.3 (freespeech)
    203.12.146.250 (octo)

I emailed these guys on Monday; I'll email them again.

Diesel's internal ip is 192.168.2.4; externally it can be reached via
ssh on 202.52.33.193:224. I've done the last digits of the external
ssh'ing to correspond to the internal ip ie:

    202.52.33.193:22 tarvat
    202.52.33.193:222: pink   192.168.2.2
    202.52.33.193:224: diesel 192.168.2.4

When conway is moved to Turrella, we could have these ports for ssh:

    202.52.33.193:223: conway 192.168.2.3
or
    202.52.33.193:22 conway
    202.52.33.193:221 tarvat 192.168.2.1
    (second option preferable, I think)

I updated the firewall on tarvat to handle above ssh, plus forwarding
dns tcp/udp port 53 to diesel 192.168.2.4.
