With scientific reasoning as one lens, and evolution as the other, you
have the most powerful pair of spectacles on the planet through which to
view life. As I am sure you are discovering, given the laudable
quality of your last post on immuno'.

This is because the fundamental thermodynamic rules underpinning the
machinery of both parasites (viri and us) are the same.

Viruses have a problem, though: their reproduction is very error-prone, so
most of them operate on the edge of their error-catastrophe threshold, so
most of the novel varieties can't reproduce competant viruses even if they
do invade a cell. What this also means is, many new viruses emerging from
a parasitized cell aren't functional (they can't even successfully infect
another cell) and some of them are outright disasters (just capsids with
no DNA inside) - but the amusing downside of this brokenness is that it
provides thousands of non-functional viruses for the immune system to 
deal with, which are in effect dummy targets for the immune system
to waste resources on, and thereby force some immune system resource
allocation to be directed away from learning about the actual viable
viruses, which benefit because they're not mopped up as efficiently as
they could otherwise be. Broken by design 8-)

As for the internal molecular parasites, non-endogenous retroviri (eg:
HIV, SIV) have no error-correction machinery encoded in their genomes, and
this means they have to (and do) code themselves in such a way as to not
render themselves susceptible to damage from the error correction
machinery of the cells they invade! This sometimes means they have to do
things like encode multiple genes on the same bit of DNA (frame-shifted,
or evern reversed on the antisense strand).

That I live in a chunk of meat in which these sorts of shifty, subtle
information-systemic subterfuges occur non-stop every day of my life, kind
of blows my head off.
