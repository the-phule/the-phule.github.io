There's this advert pasted up in bus shelters and on billboards all over
Sydney at the mo. It's got this pair of female lips pointed at a telephone
handpiece, and in large letters down the bottom of the adverts it sez

"There's a new treatment for cancer. Talking."

I know this is bollocks simply because I talk so much that if it was true
I'd never get cancer in the first place. 8-)

I also know it's bollocks 'cos you can talk about it all you like and
it'll take you out regardless. 


But I think my wry sense of humour causes me to want to go get
photographed in front of a billboard with this on it.
