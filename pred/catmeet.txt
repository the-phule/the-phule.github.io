Black.cat (a cat box at black rose)
Hugh sez we all think it's an extra outpost, easier axs for indymedia
We appear to still be secure at 2rella for a couple of years yet.

The plan is to put in a DSL dialup box in there. 
There's some plan to offset rent against bux from an unused billboard on
the roof but it appears to be undecided.

RTS-hiding.
Some-or-other alleged racist slur keeps making some of the contribs to
the RTS page disappear, presumably by editorial means. Someone figure
this out?

Andy and ned are leaving
--------------------------
Ned goes in July, for indefinitely, which means $150 a month in rent at
Black Rose falls on cat.

Andy is going to london, programming geek.

Front page:
Leah's still training people to maintain the front page, which is yet to
be implemented. I'm a bit concerned that we're sacrificing
maintainability for complexity but I might be deluded.


Kash: 
Len coughed $25
GDM gave $100
Scooter: $100

At the end of this month we'll have about $70 and will have paid off all
our connection fees. We're not in  great shape but we keep alive.


Yikes, part 382:
Hellstra are chasing our debt that Hellstra said they'd repudiate. We're
alleged to owe about $840 bux and they were gonna give us a $400
reduction. We're payin' it off at a slower rate than they want.


Attach/TPG:
Monthly fee, service fee,
TPG <dont minute this but there's something good for us>
Is Attech still a flat rate account... yes.

Inactive.
There's active for all these different cities. The code is getting old.
The site's not getting used. Nobody's looking at webkids. How to breathe
life into the project?  This was a pretty huge discussion. If someone
wants to make comments on it, feel free. 

Colourful is $70/month
Attach 1500down, 256up, is $160   : 512 would take it back to $90/month
TPG  1500down, 256up, is $170 when ya factor in the 3-monthly stuff.
About $50 for the monthly rental on the two phone lines.
Going slower would pay for us in a month.
How about we slow the bandwidth on TPG... good idea JJ. Keeps
reliability.

Leah sez the plan is: 
take the TPG link back to to 512down/128up
load sharing twixt attech and TPG
move final websites off conway to colourful
build a listserver (colourful is underpowered for lists)

Conway's unreliability is not intrinsic to the box itself, rather to
tarvat (for which we now have a hot standby) and/or the link itself.
Conway is a single point of failure for lists, lists need to work.

If we make the jump from one or the other can we use Internode?
Um... Soz's take is that supervisory scripts can be written that route
things to whatever the functional link is, of the two.

Soz's take is that we grab a debian virtual server to do 1) dns and 2)
2ndary mail exchange so if shit goes down these two important things
will keep working. 


Andy thinks we should have a list server, 'cos conway's allegedly a bit
underpowered for this.


Reliability: two links is good. Hot standby for tarvat is now working.
Replacement for Conway is in test mode.


Dismembership database
We need a suggested donation rate for members running lists.

hugh sez: colourful extra space: extra $50/year, hugh coughed it by
selling Rupert into doggie slavery.
Policy on email addresses in archives... gotta get ridda email addresses
in the body too. 
Termites exist at black rose.

Where to meet.
Accessibility at Turella sort of sucks, maybe we should advertise
accessibility for newbies at Black Rose on the weekly thurs nights.


When to meet: monthly meeting: 
6:30pm for 7pm sharp on Monday June 7th at 1 Henry St Turella
