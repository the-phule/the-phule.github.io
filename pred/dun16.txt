Thanks Curly.

One thing I've learnt from all this is that you have a remarkable
ability to stay chilled in the middle of the most difficult situations.
I appreciate it.

Yeah. They'd have to have been on both the expedition and with the planning later.
It seemed at first like the best way to go, but had some fatal flaws.
I can't see any way for people to learn a crucial lesson from this, other than by
what records there are. But yeah, there are all sorts of problems with that too.
I've learnt several lessons.

I believe Curly means our opinion on whether a large return expo was even feasible.
We had our doubts, but decided to try to work out some way to achieve it, with
minimal risk to participants.
Multiple small expos over time definately will not be possible.

complexities of doing an expo on this scale ourselves. mmmm mint sells lovely...

Thats one thing that did seem to work out OK. The power of incredible amazing
exploration to make people forget about gripes. I was so hoping to get everyone
down there, so disappointed that some people couldn't bring themselves to try it. 

>Unfortunately it wasnt as simple as that. And all of these plans we had began to deteriate,

Badly

You probably do. :-) I made it pretty clear in that 'I won't do it' email.
After which two (maybe three) of the group pulled out of it, leaving me to
decide whether to try and salvage it, or just abandon the whole thing.

That decision was made on the basis that the news of what and roughly where the place
was seemed to have leaked to the grapevine already, so the little I put on yahoogroups
didn't make it any worse. As for who... well, the three-stage details release thing we
worked out, plus that it was still soon after the 1st entry, plus the checklist for
security awareness, plus the rules I'd insist everyone agree to or not go...
could have worked out OK. Could have worked out bloody fantasticly, I still think.
Just faintly possibly, it could _still_ work. But some careful testing will need to
be done at the site.

Grapevine, chinese whispers, cliques... sigh. One of my lessons from this is that
any kind of 'secret clique' thing in CC is most unlikely to work. Never again.

No comment.

>im taking a bit of a break too. As you would have noticed I havent been turning up to any expos. I really really wish I were with you guys and gals, but its all a bit too much to handle!

Myself, I'm going to concentrate on doing some woodwork for a while.
