Oh damm, Pred, I'm very sorry to hear that.
Since, with all the drama and all, no one had their name down on the
expobase listing for Friday, and several people have said they'd prefer
a Saturday, _and_ there have been some rumours that certain people might
do something involving seccers and torches (for whatever reason), _and_
certain people are sitting on 'the map', around midday I switched the
expo status to 'cancelled'.
You should always check expobase soon before an expo, if only to read
the last minute comments by everyone interested.
I'd have phoned you, if I'd known you were still going, and if I even
knew your mobile number. (And you didn't have your mobile blocking my
number?)

Oh, and you have my phone number, could have saved yourself the whole
hour of waiting.

Yeah, everyone was either too scared (legal) or too pissed off or turned
off to go tonight.
You can blame me for the 2nd if you like (without knowing the details,
and assuming it was all my fault based on your own past misinterpretations.)

Not so far as I know.

I assume you kept a copy of the details from expobase. It will be on again,
but not at a publicly announced time. People interested in going, either
contact me, or the others of the original visitors. I'd be extremely
happy to see you along. Whichever way you want to do it, don't miss the
place. We spent years hoping and searching for something like this.

Anytime you want to stop insulting me, either for accidentally stepping
on your 'private life' corns, or in this recent case for standing up
for myself against some pretty unfair treatment (that you naturally
don't care about), just stop. There's no killfile in my mail util.
