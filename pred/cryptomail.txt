Subject: [catgeek] encrypted SMTP

BTW it appears that cat is now running encrypted SMTP:

Received: from unknown (HELO cat.org.au) (203.53.14.41)
  by spoke.minihub.org with DES-CBC3-SHA encrypted SMTP; 23 Sep 2001 01:01:06 
-0000

This means that mail between servers supporting encryption (e.g. cat to 
minihub) will travel encrypted.

cheers, Iain.
