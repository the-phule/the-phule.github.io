ok,  the openGL clone for linux ( for Xlib ) is known as mesa, i belive it's
3.4 or 3.04
the api that is gives you is the same as opengl and it's still GPL so you
can find it in debian aswell

if you got debian there's a vertual packege named libgl that you can use or,
xlibmesa3, or some other that has the name "mesa" in it.

so try

$ locate mesa

and see what you get

i've installed a few bit's but haven't got around to do any compiling..
if you whant to do a java opnegl....... there's a libary called magician..

ok,back to teh questions,
if you have XFree86 ver 4,, then you xserver will be in you path as
"XFree86" so just go
$XFree86 -version
or, if you have XFree86 3.x
then the xserver you run will be in your path (ie, XF86_VGA16, XF86_SVGA )
and just
give it the version flag and you can tell.

upgrading XFree86 ? wel get the source form xfree.org an configure then,
make world
and off you go.
for Redhat, there's a bunch of rpm's but you have to install everything you
need before you reboot
in to the next version or X or you comandline contry....
the smae for debian.  if you going to X4 there's about 10~15 you need.

well a simple one is

#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <X11/Xutil.h>
#include "GL/xmesa.h"
#include "GL/gl.h"

give it to gcc and see if it finds it :-)
they tend to be in /usr/include/GL

 did that help ??
