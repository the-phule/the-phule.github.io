>Dear list,
>
>It was an interesting time this morning at Deloittes
>
>1. The first thing they did at ths start of the meeting is to ask people sign
>non disclosure agreements.
>
>The meeting revolted at that.  So, no one signed.
>
>2. There was about 20 people at the meeting including people from a number of
>charity  / non profit as well as Aust Computer Society, state and federal
>bureaucrats etc
>
>3. They want to put M$ software on refurbished computers for charities
>
>Similar to the UK version
>http://www.microsoft.com/UK/info/community/refurbish/
>
>4. They wanted to know the level of techology people are using, ie what
>version of windows 
>
>Mostly Win95
>
>5. How many machines could be in the program
>
>They though 5,000 a yr but meeting suggested  +50,000
>
>And just remember EVERY ONE of theose "donations" are entitled to a tax
>deduction at FULL  RETAIL PRICE
>
>eg 1,000 copies of Win 98 + Office 2002

>
>Cash value $455,100
>
>It cost M$ about $5 per boxed item for package and media.
>
>There were a number of positives out of the meeting.

>
>b) Both state and federal governments understand they pay for the 'donations'
