Pred, so far I've been avoiding posting in reply to this stuff from you,
for a whole bag of reasons.

At 11:28 AM 7/03/04 +1100, you wrote:

I suppose in due time 'Mr Mod' will either get around to being a fascist
father figure and exclude me, or think twice and reverse his announcement
to try and keep things here all cosy, despite that there's a real and
seriously contentious issue to be resolved.

Cat being the unreliable, cobbled together, run by amateurs on shoestring
and connected to the net by a shoestring too, show that it seems to be,
maybe not very many people might think that a great idea.

Oh and btw, draining in the rain may be bad for your health.

This Diode is the one you've always known, with a slight patch - the 
'won't take insulting and pushy shit from anyone anymore, Rev 1.0' upgrade.
And that includes from you. Mistake I made with you was to try and give a
fuck about your feelings, and accidentally stepping into your minefield of
weird expectations of complete information exclusion regarding some
aspects of your social life. So I'm very sorry for that, but still won't
take the crap you threw at me over it.

Whats more, everyone probably thinks this Guy-Pred split probably
has something to do with jealousy over a girl. Which is wrong, and also
so unfair to me, and what I was trying to achieve, that for causing so
much shit over an attempt to be _nice_ to you, now I'm going to _really_
embaress you now. Making best attempt to _not_ embaress someone else.

Pred had done something that any normal person would think might make him
feel at least a little uncomfortable about what his good, old friend (me)
would think about it. And Pred did expect I'd hate him for it - he even
lied about it at first, thinking I'd kill him or something for it.
But the whole thing didn't bother me any, in fact I was very happy it
had happened. It occured to me (given his present situation) to reassure
Pred there were no hard feelings at all. In the process of doing which,
two short paragraphs of calm, chatty text, _clearly_ written with the
best of good will, happened to strike a very strange and sensitive nerve
I wasn't aware Pred had. And produced a response I still, and will always
think, was psychotic. As well as being extremely abusive, and demanding
that I not even reply to it or he'd killfile me.
As I said, I no longer take crap from anyone, not even him.
Gave him one opportunity to back down - sent him an appology for upsetting
him (but still a 'reply' on the topic, contrary to his ultimatum);
got another incredibly abusive attack. End of story.

Pred, I don't even want an appology from you, I know you are under a lot
of stress. I'd just like you to stop insulting me. And don't abuse me now
for 'blaming it on your problems.'

>exclusion would remain until such time as he acquires manners (you know...
>not publishing private emails, that sort of thing). Which might, going on

I might point out that a) they were _not_ private, but were all between a
group planning a (hopefully) extremely big & great CC expo, to a 'may never
be accessible again' site. Which I discovered, and _their_ bitchiness fucked
up. And b) I have not actually yet done so, just said I'm going to.

I should give you something _real_ to complain about, and publish those
emails from you. But you know I won't, and why, don't you?


>recent history, be never. It appears that so long as he remains, more and
>more people will leave this list, and leave the Clan.

I wonder if anyone actually did 'leave the list' already, hmmm?

>If whatever people remain here think it's a good idea, and provided I
>don't drown 8-) I'll try and crank it up in a couple of daze.

Small problem of new 'Mr Mod' currently having a rep as behaving very oddly,
and expected future difficulties of maintaining that list.

Speaking of behaving oddly, lets talk about your going to the Hornsby Inn
on Friday night, and finding no one else there. I previously said I was sorry
to hear that, and why didn't you check expobase before going, since I'd
flagged the expo as cancelled around midday.
Now I find out that someone did in fact tell you verbally that afternoon
that the expo was off, and you clearly acknowledged that information.

Did you ever get that head CAT scan done? If not, I wish you would.
