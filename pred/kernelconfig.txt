Ok.

(All above configured with Y as the make option not M 8-))
Changes: 
no PCMCIA support now (there are no PCMCIA devices on conway.)
Added loopback device support (fixes sometimes-not-loaded-loop0 for sql)
No SCSI support (there are no SCSI devices on conway.)
Added 3Com card support (I thought this was there already!)
Specifically Etherlink III, Fast Etherlink, Vortex/Boomerang (we use this).
No support for other ISA NIC's.
PCI network card support was already there, for
  EEpro100, PCI NE2K clones, RTL8139 FastEther
No mouse support (there has never been a mouse on conway)
i8x0 Random number generator support (better crypto, needs P-III I think)
No AGP support (there is no NVidia graphics accelerator on Conway)
No DRI manager (there is no Xfree86 on Conway).
Added Reiser FS support but with no debug cos it goes really slow.
Added Reiser FS /proc stats support
Added Ext3 FS support but no JDB debugging for same
Added DOS FAT and MSDOS-FS support as modules
NFS FS and server available as modules if we need them (not v3).
No soundcard support
No USB support

Zzzzzzzzzzz!
