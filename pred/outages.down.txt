Hi JJ. I just interrogated the DSL firewall /var/log/messages for the
last few days. They're all like this. LCP terminated by peer is what
pppoe sez to the logfile when the remote connection is severed so I
grepped the files for that to timestamp the outages in the last few
days. Sonia's supervisory script in cron, which checks the link is up,
reattempts to start the downed DSL link to attech, every minute until it
succeeds; when it does it records, amongst other stuff, the secondary
DNS address entry of the new link (always the same) also with a
timestamp. The difference in these timestamps is how long we've been
offline.


May 10 01:01:04 tarvat pppd[15823]: LCP terminated by peer
May 10 09:29:05 tarvat pppd[5514]: secondary DNS address 203.220.24.5
Approx eight hours offline.

May 11 01:01:33 tarvat pppd[5514]: LCP terminated by peer
May 11 08:38:07 tarvat pppd[25620]: secondary DNS address 203.220.24.5
Approx seven and a half hours offline.

May 12 04:15:01 tarvat pppd[25620]: LCP terminated by peer
May 12 08:30:11 tarvat pppd[8661]: secondary DNS address 203.220.24.5
approx four and a quarter hours offline.

May 13 01:23:26 tarvat pppd[8661]: LCP terminated by peer
May 13 08:16:40 tarvat pppd[27914]: secondary DNS address 203.220.24.5
Approx eight hours offline.

May 13 13:07:41 tarvat pppd[27914]: LCP terminated by peer
May 13 13:09:12 tarvat pppd[29781]: secondary DNS address 203.220.24.5
May 13 13:14:07 tarvat pppd[29867]: LCP terminated by peer
May 13 13:15:19 tarvat pppd[29898]: secondary DNS address 203.220.24.5

A few minutes outage, no biggie but the supervisory script records a
pair of consecutive outages in rapid succession at a totally different
time to when it normally happens. Huh?


May 14 00:43:37 tarvat pppd[29898]: LCP terminated by peer
May 14 09:11:08 tarvat pppd[17637]: secondary DNS address 203.220.24.5
Approx eight hours out. Again.

And so on. Today too. I won't bore you with more of it.

Are we paying two thirds of the standard rate? We appear to be getting
two thirds of a link, plus these outages are timed in such a way as
messes up our rsyncing to mirrors (which we paid for, to get around
these drop outs) so they're late on the mirrors, too.

Attech have jerked us around significantly for at least three
incidences... getting the link started they swore black and blue nothing
was wrong at their end (it was Veridas' problem but they didn't tell us
this). A few months ago ports for mail and web services were also
chopped without warning and we had to pay for them to change us to
connect.com just to maintain the level of service we were already paying
them to provide. Now this sustained imbecility. Plus they're jerking you
around too. 

I'm sort of dying and would prefer not to spend the remains of my short
life dealing with these incompetant bozos. I'd dump 'em and send the
logs to the ombudstwonk if I could be fucked and didn't have other
things to do. I hope this illuminates their problem for them.
