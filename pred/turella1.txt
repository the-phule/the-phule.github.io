Don is one of the residents at the Turella warehouse. 

He mentioned to me today that there is a group of people (ARTV) wanting to
come in to run their operations at the Turella premises. The residents are
considering the possibility of a reshuffle of spaces (including their
rooms, excluding the places sub-rented out). FOE's and IMC's spaces are
being considered as places where ARTV could go.

ARTV are pretty continuously functional, and will pay rent (we're sort of
doing a freeloady thing, insofar as we were invited). 

When we moved here we just grabbed stuff and dropped it in particular
rooms, we're pretty flexible, so provided we have a space somewhere which
we can function in, this sounds like it's ok. A move from one room to
another is nowhere near as nasty as a move from suburb to suburb.
