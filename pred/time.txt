Hi dude. 

Well, I climbed in the CT scanner on saturday and found out why my back
hurts. Yet another neoplasm, close to the original scene of the crime.
It's putting pressure on my inferior vena cava which is the big pipe which
takes used blood from my legs and a few other things and routes it up to
my heart. It goes ow every time my heart beats and I've run out of ways to
get posturally comfortable so I'm starting to throw painkillers down my
neck. There's additional right retrocaval lymph nodes involved now, too. 

I'd love 'em to chop this shit out. Dad's take is that in his clinical
experience chopping these things out "doesn't alter outcomes" as he put it
so they'll probably go the nuclear weapons option and blast it with some
or other species of radiation. Which the literature tells me doesn't alter
outcomes much either. Ah, the literature.... said I'd likely be showing up
with cryptic mets like these within the year after the kidney was
flung. Sure enough, I have. 


Goldfrapp's Felt Mountain has nine tracks on it, cost thirty bucks and is
not as good as Black Cherry I think, much darker. THough I've gotta give
it a few more listens.


Bill hasn't changed. I see a bloke tomorrow who will decide if he can be
fucked trying to chop it out.
 
I'm not generally inclined to jerk people's schedules around to suit me,
though I'm very conscious that my remaining time's sorta shortening quite
rapidly. I'm elapsing. I'm entering that window where nothing will be fun
any more, 'cos I'll be sick as a dog from treatment, if I decide to have a
go, and sick as a dog from disease if I decide not to. So if you're still
inclined to, you should catch me nowish.


I miss ya and love ya and it sucks not being near you.
