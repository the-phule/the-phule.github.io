Sorry, I thought I was clearly standing against the idea of kicking
people off the list in any circumstance, so long as they are still
CC members. And there has only been one instance (I recall) of someone
being kicked out of CC.

Of course, I'd like to see Marauder back on.

I'd say he was serious, and commenting on the (lack of) wisdom in
even trying to impose rules on the CC list.

Seconded, except with no proviso, and I'd like to see a Mod who
promised to _not_ treat the CC list in the way that I agree lists
like 'International eye candy' probably have to be run.
We do have some advisories. They get posted every month. Note that
not discussing details of others illegal actions is rather more
important than 'being nice'.

And that, btw, is one on my biggest problems with putting up that
'emails of the S6' thing somewhere. Its quite a quandry. How to
show the stupid crap that went on over the matter of who'd be in
vs out, without putting some people to real legal risk re their
actions on an expo?
Never mind their dammed feelings.

By the nature of CC and the people in it, there are going to be
strong differences of opinion now and then. People who think
otherwise are kidding themselves.

But there is _one_ thing we all have to be sure of - that we can
trust each other not to blow anything really serious. Blowing each
other off now and then is sad but to be expected. And ultimately
harmless. See the whole new dimension to list moderation yet?

Mod has started on a path I see as incompatible with the nature of
the clan. Why put off an inevitable argument you can have now?
Its got to be either resolved now, or it will keep coming back.
A guarantee from Mod that uncensored list posting rights are a
simple consequence of CC membership, or I will continue to be a
noisy pain in the butt till Mod removes me - or the CC kicks me
off the membership list.

And I don't actually have anything personal against either
Ogre or Siolo. Just a philosophical difference of opinion.
Plus, I sure could do without _another_ major argument just now,
especially having just damaged myself in the eyes of those who
weren't there, and so don't understand what I was 'whinging' about.
But so be it.

This isn't a family forum, Traceroute.
And if you read back (past last week), you'll see that four letter
words are not something I normally use. Hmm. Well, not often. See also-
"Note that I'm being deliberately rude so you have a good excuse"

But still, I see when it comes to me Mod didn't apply the standard
he applied to Marauder. Who also is not so prone to being abusive,
and (I'd guess) was also providing a deliberate target for application
of rules he didn't agree with, and thought could only lead to trouble.
(Hence his "and so it begins.")
