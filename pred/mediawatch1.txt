Subject: IMC Media Watch: The Guardian Edit... cautionary media tales No.1

Here's just the sort of tripe we'll be dealing with for the next few
months.

Notice the uh, slight discrepancy between what I said:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
> >Why are you targeting the games?

Because the Games has targetted us. The IOC is the final stage of
corporate evolution - an immortal, transnational organisation, optimised
for serial parasitisation of the governments and treasuries of host
nations. They don't produce anything, they redirect local resources to 
the furtherance of their own ends, they ignore the needs of the global
citizenry and in particular, they use an associate vector lifeform, the
corporate media, to distribute memes which infect the brains of the local
human populace which makes them largely incapable of understanding that
they have been invaded and have had their precious internal resources
stolen and wasted.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


and what Dodsie said I said... (via Christine, thanks for the ascii)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<chop>
Protesters see the Games as an embodiment of the excesses of global
capitalism. "The International Olympic Committee is the final stage of
corporate evolution," said Predator. "They don't produce anything, they
redirect local resources to further their own ends, they ignore the
needs of the global citizenry and they use the corporate media to
distribute their aims."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ok, so I'm a bit of a gasbag (Ok ok, so BOC have a 25mm pipe stuck into my
throat for peak load times 8-) ... dont pick on me). But look at the
lossage! Lots of good, insightful tools left on the cutting room floor to
satisfy journalistic brevity. Exactly what the IMC is against. I hope.

And here's more.... this is what I said:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We'll be a reality-channel you can turn to when real life's resemblance to
TV becomes too painful. Want to post stories about the olympics, but with
a different take to the blind fanatical praise and glorification dished
out by CNN/MSN ? Welcome aboard.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

And here's what Dodsie said I said.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"We'll be a reality channel you can turn on," said an activist calling
himself Predator, who claimed to represent the Independent Media
Centre. "Want to post stories about the Olympics, but with a different
take to the blind praise and glorification dished out by CNN/MSN?
Welcome aboard."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A close match, but a subtle difference.

I used the term "turn to" in the sense of succor in the face of screaming
mainstream media banality - succor implies interactivity, beings helping
each other. Now, Dodsie said that I said "turn on" which either means you
can attack it, or that it's like a television and look at it and not
contribute to it - neither of which shades of meaning did I intend to
convey. That's why I used the words "turn to".  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I evidently mistook him for someone who thinks I can understand English.
Hmmm... I also evidently mistook _him_ for someone who can understand
English.

I think he thinks the public can't learn a new idea.

I know it's bad form to post private posting to a newsgroup, one can
consider this retaliatory for putting words in my mouth that were never
there. So here beings the education of Mr Dodson from the guardian:

> If meme means 'to copy" why not say that. 

If these belief systems were copying themselves like they were stuck
in a jammed photocopier, I would use the word "copy".  Use of the word
"meme" implies copying processes of data structures primarily adapted for
their own *self-replication*... they dynamically adapt to benefit their
own propagation.

<Rhetoric detection invoked: now attacking inbuilt assumption that bus
drivers are ignorant>

The bus driver, who is probably literate, has the opportunity to equip
themself with the tools required to understand their universe. You, the
journalist, are the primary provider of such tools. 

I do not write in such a way as to assume the public is either ignorant or
incapable of learning new words or ideas. Such a stance is denigratory to
them and lowers the information content of journalism in general. Denying
the readership access to new words is exemplary of the very same
dumbing-down we wish to avoid at IMC.

If you wish to write children's literature you can assume adults will have
full understanding of the content, but little interest in reading it.

If you wish to add in the information that a meme is a chunk of
self-interested information which wishes to facilitate its own
replication, you as the journalist are free to add this information in.

Capitalism is a meme complex. I suggest you clue into the ramifications of
memes. The aforementioned Dawkins reference is significant and worth
reading.

And here's some additional amusement.

I do not directly see how my gender has any significance.  Use the first
person.

Immortal. As in, not programmed to self-extinguish. There are other sorts
of immortal information systems, for examples tumor cells.... they don't
age or die off as a regular cell might, because the natural process of
programmed cell death is inhibited and the cell is also permanently
configured to replicate (as are all of its progeny). Corporations are
potentially immortal, as are political parties and religions.

Way back in the early days of corporate evolution, back before they were
called corporations, they were known as joint stock companies. One
philospher (Adam Smith?) expressed trepidation about them, and stated that
they were like "immortal persons". The IOC has an expected lifespan of
several hundred years, much longer than the lifespan of any of its
constituent human members.
 
In general, corporations have no morals, with the possible exception of
shareholder and managerial greed.

> "to distribute memes" - I'm sorry my dictionary does not contain this word,
> would you like to rephrase it?

No. The word (meme, singular, from the latin root mimeme, meaning "to
copy") was coined by Richard Dawkins in chapter 10 of The Selfish Gene
(2nd ed, Oxford press) in the late 1970s. A meme is a unit of cultural 
data transmission, in much the same way as a gene is a unit of hereditary
data transmission.

In much the same way as a computer virus is a chunk of information which
compels the host system to replicate more computer viruses, and a
biological virus is a chunk of nucleotidylly encoded information which
compels the host cell to make more biological viruses, a meme complex (see
Blackmore, The Meme Machine) is a bunch of mutually self-supporting ideas
which makes up a belief system. Religions, political philosophies,
corporate ethoses are composed of memes. Some memes are totally at odds
with reality but that doesn't actually matter at all so long as the entire
belief system can get you to allocate enough of your processivity (brain)
and bandwidth (mouth) to propagating it into the brains of other people.
The epidemiology of this has been investigated by H Keith Henson, look him
up on the net.

I think we'd like to distribute some different (useful) tools for
thinking about the olympukes, and sound a warning to the rest of Earth's
citizenry concerning the true nature of the IOC and the motivations behind
it.... innoculate them against the parasite before they can be infected by
it.

When you come to the conclusion that the available news isn't worth the
effort of reading, that's when you need to write your own.
