Apparently, it will be run with zero. The completely bust-free guarantee.

things you accuse the rest of the secret six of, so don't think you are any
better than them because you can write long emails and fessed up first.

The email archive is going to take a while to get on yahoo, precisely
because there's a lot of private and location related stuff that has
to be snipped.
I still want to put it up though. Good lesson in why 'inner groups'
are a bad idea. Not to mention sorting out who was really the
prime insulter of who.

As for friends... I don't kid myself about how many I had in the
first place. So I'm not particularly concerned if in showing
what shits some others can be, I make myself look bad too.

Heh. Truth and honesty, I'd like. Happiness is rarely attainable,
and none of them are reachable via religion.
In the Clan, I'll settle for not being treated like someone
who's opinions, wishes and integrity are of no concern at all
to those speaking to me. (Bearing in mind that I've no complaints
about anything prior to this episode.)

Where did I say they were?
But alcohol is unwise during planning meetings, and late night
angry email sessions.

Expecting someone to lie to their friend, to hide your own prejudice
against that friend - now that is a marker of character.
