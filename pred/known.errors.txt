Sorry to whinge about this but in the interest of setting the record
straight, here's some changes which should be made to known.doc v11.002

Abyss: Found by predator, after trawling the SUSS Bull articles by
deceased cave diver Rolf Adams; 1991.

Amaroo: Found by predator while wandering around his employer's place in
George's Hall, 1993.

Anzac 91 folly: pred knew about these by 1992 but decided, after being
spoilt by Melbourne, that they weren't very good so never listed 'em.

Autobahn: Found 1993 by Pred, informed by Greg Samuel who worked in a
computer factory which had a carpark backing onto the drain outlet.

Blackwattle Bay: Found by Dougo, Wes, et al by 1991. See edition 14, 15 of
early Il Draino.

Coalcliff: Diode found this, don't know when, tho.

Cocayne: Not on list but found by predator in about 1997 and frankly it's
pretty boring.

Deep throat: I am sure Diode found this. I videotaped the entire thing for
work, in 1996.

Eyes: I am sure Diode found this before I got to it.

Jigging: Diode also found this.

Pyramid: diode found that on account of finding Swoo, of which Pyramid is
part. Diode and I found Swoo together but the actual slide which led to
its name is now not open-air, it has been encapsulated in the first stage
of the tunnel.


###Bridges:

Alford's point was initiall accessed by Diode, Mullet and I, using ropes.
Como rail was definately first accessed by diode and mullet - not me.
Gladesville Bridge was initially accessed by diode and predator in 1993.
Tom Ugly's was definately got into long before 1996. Try 1992.


Congrats on an otherwise very fine known.doc!
