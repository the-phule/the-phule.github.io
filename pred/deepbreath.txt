And a poor effort of mine, that I made the mistake of posting to
a USA current events usenet group, and am now getting serious
hate mail from US redneck loonies about:

------------------------------------------------------------------
Take a DEEEEP breath, America
-----------------------------
Thousands dead - seems like a lot of people when its in your own
city, your own country.

But I'd like to point out that _millions_ have died internationally
as a result of American political policies: economic and military.
US support of corrupt regimes (Southeast Asia, South America) that
led to revolutions, wars and general economic destruction and social
tragedy. Remember Vietnam and Cambodia? The Kmer Rouge were born out
of the madness of US indiscriminate bombing of Cambodian countryside,
including phosphorus bombs. And defoliation of entire forests and
agricultural land. Most of my wife's family were killed by the Kmer
Rouge, along with many millions of other Cambodians. None of that
mess would have happened if the US hadn't wanted to make an example
of a small country (Vietnam), for reasons mostly related to US oil
interests and a desire to sabre rattle at the Russians.

Thats just one example. Read Chomsky, and try to understand that
the USA has made a _lot_ of deeply bitter enemies worldwide. Whole
countries reduced to starving, smoking ruins, that would have just
gone on living relatively peacefully without US intervention (in the
name of economic dominance.) Serbia, Yugoslavia - wrecked in order
for the US to get a foot into the coal, oil, iron, etc resources of
that region. Allende's Chile, trashed just to put a stop to an
interesting experiment in economics. Iraq (recall that Saddam was
helped into power by the US originally, literally told by the US
that it was 'OK' to invade Kuwait, then deliberately left in power
by the US, just so the Iraqi oil reserves would stay off the world
market, thus stabilizing the world oil prices at a 'convenient'
level. Never mind the lives of the peoples of such countries.

Oh and the Taliban? Who was it funded and armed those religious
nuts, to keep a fight going against Russia when they were trying
their own stupid invasion? Then played off the various sects one
against another towards the end, thus ensuring 'survival of the
maddest'? Why, the good 'ol USA.
As for religious fundamentalism - don't cast stones. Look to your
own brands of fundamentalist, anti-reason Christian sects. Not to
mention which country gave us Scientology.

Even here in Australia (one of the USA's staunchest allies, on the
face of things) there are many who know the history of US intervention
in our own political scene, and resent that. At least there was no
blood shed here (unless you count our soldiers lost fighting alongside
the US in that senseless war in Vietnam, or perhaps the 30 or so who
died in a shooting massacre in Tasmania - that may or may not have
been a political psyop planned with US interests in mind.

I imagine the Russians were not very happy about the Kursk 'accident'
either, and the fact that it was on manouvers at the time to trial
a new weapons system that would have shifted the global balance of
naval power solidly to Russia's side never crossed the minds of US
military agencies.

My advice: stay calm. You can't win against mindless terror by
becoming mindless yourself. And you don't stay free by tightening
up security till there are no freedoms left. Killing and destruction
is always evil, regardless of the 'reasons' or 'justification'.

But I know you won't stay calm. I know you will go absolutely,
murderously berserk, and bomb, nuke, assassinate, and generally
apply the military boot to every possible target in sight.
You're gonna show those bastards who's who, right? And a lot more
people are going to die, most of them civilians in their homes,
farms, villages, etc. You'll pretend to count them, but the figures
will be 'estimates'. But who cares, its a 'new world order' and
you are the self-elected world cop and city hall all in one.

Well, try not to wreck too much of the planet before the oil and
gas run out in a few years, thats all I ask. We'll see massive
death and destruction then, much more than soon enough.

Oh, and do please remember the Reichstag Fire.

Guy,
You stupid bleeding heart liberal asshole...go fuck yourself, your Cambodian
rice-cooking wife and your kangaroo!
I hope we take Osama and his pack of murderous bandits and turn them all to
dust!  I hope we nuke the bastard and light up his desert so hot that it all
turns to glass!

Lovely people, with the President they deserve.

I missed the TV footage last night, due to being on a mission.
Ah, the darkness, the moonlight, the barriers neutralised, what joy!
Better than sitting in front of the TV, any night.

Hopefully I can find avi's of the choice clips on the web, to keep forever.
