Stuff:

Publicity, getting more people to use and promote the IMC site.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Len suggested getting involved in the orientation weeks at
uni; the greens are doing some of that sort of stuff, and
it makes sense to stick pamphlets or something like that
at O-week (late Feb); this is also a good time to whack some
propaganda in the student newspapers as well.

Maybe there's some need for some demonstration of how to use the site, too,
if someone wanted to bring a rig down, set it u at a tent and lug it
out every night. 2SER seemed to need it so other people might too.

It might be worth chatting to the student press (honi soit, etc) and
offering them an interview.... hoover up some contributors from the student
pool. <pred> can do that in late Feb at a date to be set.

There's a time allocated for working on these publicity issues (make
press releases, that sort of stuff) on Tues Jan 23 at 17 Lord St warehouse
6:30pm.

A good idea would be to have a sort of a launch day to introduce people to
the new AV machine when it comes. Tell 'em to bring their own videotapes.

It's probably worth targetting specifically the people who study journalism
... put notices up in their noticeboards, talk to the lecturers: hand out
lists of suggested stories (which people can contribute to, of course);

Action:
- writing a page about how to write stories (brett).
- generating materials for journalism teachers to give their students.
- modifying university courses so the students get to play with the IMC stuff
   and comment on it, use it (pred, you naughty boy you).
- putting a link on the sidebar showing how to throw a story together (mlis).


Globalisation of the IMC
-------------------------

M'liss was on the IMC IRC chat ... there was lots of farting around and some
commentors said the american boys had too much input.

Brett pointed out that if it is considered that an IMC is not doing open
publishing maybe it could be controlled a bit by taking the link off the
local pages. Looks like indymedia is now starting to have some effective
decision making processes. The discussion is difficult to find, see
lists.indymedia.org if you wanna subscribe yourself to the discussions.

We are getting a lot of north America centric postings which have low
significance to our situation here.

Lenny reckons he might be able to score a minidisc

Radio
---------------------
Brett did a 30min segment on 2SER called IMC-on-air (at the moment).
It consisted of pulling stories off various indymeda sites around
the world  AND TELLING THEM THAT THEY CAN PUBLISH THEIR OWN STUFF!!!

WOW! Participatory media seeps back into the aether!!! WOOOOW! 

Fri morning, 0900 to 09:30.

It's planned to occur every week. lookat imc-sydney-radio@cat.org.au
for some of th relevant discussions.

The time slot was a bit slow.  Music cut it down to 20 mins. 

Dusk mentioned that he wanted to make a contrib to this program, it's
partly pre-recorded on the aforementioned thursday. All of the IMC's
are trawled, and the format is being stll worked out a lot but much of the
content is local.  Melbourne indymedia have been apprached about
collaboration on this project. The minidisc is going to be
digitised sometime soon by jj.



New AV machine.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
JJ has the cheque from Melborne, and Newcastle have sent a
cheque to Winway. He's heard no noise concerning a cdrom burner from Emu
so will get one during the winway purchase. The plan was to get an
Oprey200 but the 220 has a breakout box and other cool features.

We're gonna announce the aquisition, get Winway to build and test it, and
we whack our own OS on it.



Active-IMC merge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Maffew recons: Active sydney is an activist calendar and performs news and
a few other local grass rootsy functions. Active turned into the
engine that drove j18 which then spawned indymedia. There's a fair bit
of overlap on the news function on these sites, now.

His proposal is that active retains its calendrical function and
IMC takes the news.

Hugh wearing his IMC cap... gonna post to webkids@active.org.au
concerning this proposal.



Shifts
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Need consolidation. The staffing pages were a great idea and work
well. There needs to be some way that people can get the keys.


Len
-------------------------------------------------------------
All the macs now have good monitors. There's a slightly faster
mac on the desk. He's still trying to offload a bunch of old macs
which we cannot use. Carnivale is offloading some old Macs. 


Loads of dosh.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
We've now got a grand in the bank. Arrangements were made to
extract caaaash for the AV box.

Payment has to be made to the people who provided the video for
the screening. Hugh'll email the people and  tell 'em we didnt
make any real bux out of it, we'll fling 'em fifty south pacific
pesos too cover their costs.

Oh, yeah someone wrote a form saying JJ could pull out some cash for the
impending exenditure on the osprey card.


Cat's stll paying for IMC's voice fone, but it's considered
sustainable by the cat heads. Voicemail ($11 a month) is still on the
indymedia fone line, for which cat pays.
Tell telstra that we own the fone and shouldn't charge equipment rental
for it (pulls it down to $5 a month). We'll cancel the voicemail and whack
in an answering machine.


The Warehouse (17 Lord St) is being auctioned.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The residents are getting legal advice concerning wether or not there
needs to be vacant possession. Worst case scen is we have to be
outta here 22March. 

The next meeting will include a discussion of where the IMC will go,
and where the cat server will go. 


Cat server
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Indymedia is in Colorado, USA. Cat's server is now in The Wilderness
Society. We still have a telstra fone link to the rest of the net,
which keeps the warehouse online.


Meeting frequency
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The general word is that monthly meetings are yummy. It's probably
good to shift it to monthly, 2nd tues of the month. This means the
next one is on the 13th of Feb 2001. Mliss'll put this meeting on
Active Sydney.

Sketchad
----------------------------------------------------------------------
is a bunch of people who create social commentry and political satirists
in a commercial-type format. They've offered their services in collaborating
with editing and post-production of little video skits and stuff. Hit
samahaha@yahoo.com.au  for more info about this. Fone 9365-3623,
0402 397 777 ask for john.


Spam 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sucks. The next thing we can do is upgrade to mailman. Pred kills
spambots. 


Whistleblowers 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There's an issue raised concerning the anonymity of a whistleblower
posting. Yes, postings can be tracked cos the auto logs on the servers
do this by default. Mliss pointed out that postings can't be tracked
from a public netcafe (there's no correlation between a machine and a person
using it. There are places around called anonymizers. We could
modfy or scramble our logs or whatever. 

Whistleblowers Australia would be good to talk to about this.

Mlis made another great suggestion that there be a link on the page
enabling anonymised postings.
