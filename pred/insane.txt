Cont: The drooling rant of someone trying to install a scanner under RedHat.

The scanner is a OpticPro 4800P. By a co called Plustek. Has a D25
input and D25 output, the latter goes to a printer if you have one.

I do wish I didn't have to generate this list by doing an rpm -i blah
only to discover that it needs some other package. I discovered I
needed sane by trying to install xsane, and I then discovered I needed
sane-devel when I tried to install sane... oh, I then discovered I
needed sane-1.0.1 and not 1.0.3. Extrapolate the same thing for
QuiteInsane... I discovered I needed qt. Then qt-devel. Then qt-designer. 
Anyway, there's a happyish end to all this.

Here's the stuff I've downloaded so far, mainly from rpmfind/powertools
and baobab's FTP server -

sane-1.0.1-4.i386.rpm
sane-1.0.3-10.i386.rpm
sane-devel-1.0.1-4.i386.rpm
xsane-0.78.tar.gz
xsane-0.47-2.i386.rpm
quiteinsane-0.2-alpha.tar.gz
qt-2.2.1-1.6x.i386.rpm
qt-designer-2.2.1-1.6x.i386.rpm
qt-devel-2.2.1-1.6x.i386.rpm


Here's what I get when I try to install it:

# rpm -i sane-devel-1.0.1-4.i386.rpm
# rpm -q sane-devel
  sane-devel-1.0.1-4

(good)

# rpm -i sane-1.0.3-10.i386.rpm

only packages with major numbers <= 3
are supported by this version of RPM
error: sane-1.0.3-10.i386.rpm cannot be
installed

(What's a major number? Anyway, then I try this one, then...)

# rpm -i sane-1.0.1-4.i386.rpm
# rpm -q sane
  sane-1.0.1-4

(All right, so sane and sane-devel are
in, let's push my luck...)

# rpm -i xsane-0.47-2.i386.rpm
# rpm -q xsane
  xsane-0.47-2

(So maybe I can invoke it from within a
terminal in the X GUI:)

# xsane

A window comes up : NO DEVICES
AVAILABLE. This is encouraging, since at
the moment there are no devices,
because I have a different problem,
which is to wire a DB25male===DB25female
cable correctly. This is IEEE 1284
standard but I can't find anything
anywhere which says pin x on male goes
to pin y on female. 

Does this frontend do autodetect? 

Anyway....

------------------------------------------------
I had a load of fun trying to get the
quiteInsane package to ./configure and
compile, initally. Now I think I have 
the required stuff, so I do:

#rpm -i qt-2.2.1-1.6x.i386.rpm

and that gets me this message:

/sbin/ldconfig: warning: can't open
/usr/lib/qt-2.1.0/lib (no such file or
directory), skipping

Despite the bitching, it apparently
installed, because:

# rpm -q qt
qt-2.2.1-1.6x

# rpm -i qt-devel-2.2.1-1.6x.i386.rpm
# rpm -q qt-devel
qt-devel-2.2.1-1.6x

Ok, then, lets' add this:

#rpm -i qt-designer-2.2.1-1.6x.i386.rpm
rpm -q qt-designer
qt-designer-2.2.1-1.6x

Right. Well, lets see if we can't get quiteinsane to go, 
now I think I have all the tools for it.

I play with the quiteInsane tarball thus:

# tar -zxvf quiteinsane-0.2-alpha.tar.gz
# cd quiteinsane-0.2-alpha
# ./configure

machine goes into an orgy of checking
for libraries, makes its Makefile. I get this:


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ QuiteInsane is now configured for compilation.          +
+                                                         +

+ trouble. Thank you.                                     +
+ Have fun...                                             +

So now for the compile, something for the CPU to get warm about...

# make 

It did a LOT of work, 233MHz pentium, 99% CPU load, 
for about 10 mins.

No errors, yay. So now I go for the install:

# make install

Seems happy with that. let's try and run it:

/root/quiteinsane-0.2-alpha/quiteinsane# ./quiteinsane

and it runs... a detailed window comes up, reminiscent of the same
interface for the printer configuration tool called printtool.

Anyway, the compile and install finally seems to be working for
both. Next chapter, getting it to talk to the scanner...
