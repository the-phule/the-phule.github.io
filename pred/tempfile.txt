I thought about it several times while figuring out what s/he'd done, and
came to the conclusion that in fact s/he chose me to be the instrument by
which he decided to ruin their life. Seriously, you'd have to be a wally
to choose to 'sploit the account of some ponce who runs around calling
'emselves predator, wouldn't ya? ;)

I am not *dead* sure why conway's been flaky in the last few days, I have
strong suspicions about /dev/hda but I also wasn't especially happy that
when i attempted to ssh into conway from the adjacent firewall that the
available bandwidth being so completely used up by this dude that I
couldn't log in elsewhere than the tty. Cat time, disk space, labour and
bandwidth have been wasted on this git when we're far better off
allocating it to getting /dev/hda sorted out.

Anyway, as usual we've uncovered something a bit larger than we
expected. Now read on.
