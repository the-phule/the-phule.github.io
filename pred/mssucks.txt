Subject: MS has perfected the art of the fucking annoying error message.

I was forced to use XP today, I have seen the following error message at
least two hundred times, 6 times whilst quoting the message. I do not have
the Windows Explorer browser open.... maybe that's that they call their OS
now, tho.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows Explorer has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are
sorry for the inconvenience. If you were in the middle of something the
information you were working on might be lost. PLEASE TELL MICROSOFT ABOUT
THIS PROBLEM. We have created an error report that you can send to help us
improve Windows Explorer. We will treat this report as confidential and
anonymous. To see what data this error report contains CLICK HERE

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Natch this comes up right in the middle of the fucking screen right on top
of whatever you're trying to do. It wont go away unless you click one of
the buttons. If you click the SEND ERROR REPORT button another window
comes up which also asks you to click it. This cycle repeats about twice a
minute.

ARRR! FUCK! FUCK! BLOODY BLOODY FUCKING FUCK!!! BILL GATES DIE, DIE, DIIIE!
