Yeah. That one gave me the best laugh I've had from this whole stupid
and sordid episode.
Btw, since Willow SMS'd me yesterday that this location is 'way too
dodgy to ever go back - if the authorities aren't aware of our activities
by now they are not doing their job', I guess all the location details
in the emails are no longer of any relevance, and I might as well publish
the lot uncensored. Apart from one accusation I made thats both impossible
for me to prove, and impossible for the other person to disprove.

When and if it does go up, it will be at http://everist.org/S6_email.zip
As a zip file, on a web site - not to waste more bandwidth here.
Since I probably will be kicked off this list when 'Mod' reads
my comments to him, anyone interested in the deliberations of the
defunct 'secret expo planning group' can email me privately - should
I publish it or not?
