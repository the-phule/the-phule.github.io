Cont: documentation of the repair of the brickwork near the large glass
sliding door.

The brickwork came apart as if the cement were made of biscuit mix. This
mix is used elsewhere in the building, unfortunately, and there's similar
structural integrity failure in the corner near the bathroom window and
the window into the corridor.

The bricks were cleaned of their cement with a chisel. Two superfluous
bricks - not holding anything up, were removed. Four rows of bricks were
removed and re-cemented. In the meantime the door jamb was propped up with
an offcut from a nearby tree.

Re-setting of the top row of bricks would have required removal of the
roof tiles except I decided to remove the running board instead and re-set
them from underneath. This removal of the running board section was a good
idea because

1) it's made of disintegrating laminate. I will replace it with real wood
when I locate suitable material. The rest of the running board is Oregon,
painted white.

2) removal of the running board permitted inspection of the cavity under
the tiles. The sark is in good condition. One batten exhibited dry rot,
probably from decades ago before the two back rooms were built. It was cut
out, and replaced, by screwed-in pine batten, painted with fungicide in
advance. All the adjacent joists, rafters, appear to not be infected with
it and are structurally sound. They were all painted in fungicide anyway
as a precaution.

3) some old flax-sheathed electrical conduit remained in the wall space. I
removed it.

The courtyard light has also been re-installed and is functional again.
