Subject: Re: [catgeek] Final call. After this,
     I do harddisk transplants they're easier. 

machine A:
ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0

machine B:
ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0
route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0

machine A test:
ifconfig
route
ping 10.0.0.2

machine B test:
ifconfig
route
ping 10.0.0.1

(ping from one machine actually tests both directions)

if ping works, tcp/ip works. any problems with ftp are due to the client
or server ftp software, or to do with inetd on the server.

machine B:
ftp 10.0.0.1
<commence to suck large files>

documentation:
man route - has useful examples
man ifconfig - doesn't have useful examples :(

cheers and good luck,
m.
