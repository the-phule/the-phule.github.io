Subject: Re: MAPS: Salvia power?

Hi Kyle,
Salvinorin-A produces effects that are more powerful than LSD.   However LSD
delivers its full effect at 250 micrograms or so whereas Salvinorin-A delivers
its full effect at 500 micrograms.   Therefore LSD is more powerful by weight
but Salvinorin-A is more powerful by effect.   My own experience is that after
having done LSD some hundreds of times in the 1960s and 1970s, Salvia
Divinorum's effects through smoked leaves were more powerful by far than any
LSD effects i have experienced.   I had my first out of body experience the
first time I smoked leaves.  I avoid such high doses of Salvia Divinorum and
favour the use of fresh or dried leaves held in the mouth.   This effect is
quite gentle and not like the shock therapy effect of smoked or inhaled
Salvinorin-A.  I would recommend using it in a safe environment and to use it
in a meditative way.
