  4.2.  Patterns

  Many of Mutt's commands allow you to specify a pattern to match
  (limit, tag-pattern, delete-pattern, etc.).  There are several ways to
  select messages:

       ~A              all messages
       ~N              new messages
       ~T              tagged messages
       ~D              deleted messages

       ~p              message is addressed to you (consults $alternates)
       ~P              message is from you (consults $alternates)

       ~f USER         FROM:		messages originating from USER
       ~e EXPR         			message which contains EXPR in the ``Sender'' field
       ~s SUBJECT      SUBJECT:		messages having SUBJECT in the ``Subject'' field.
       ~b EXPR         BODY:		messages which contain EXPR in the message body
       ~B EXPR         			messages which contain EXPR in the whole message

       ~d [MIN]-[MAX]  messages with ``date-sent'' in a Date range
       ~r [MIN]-[MAX]  messages with ``date-received'' in a Date range
       ~m [MIN]-[MAX]  message in the range MIN to MAX *)
       ~n [MIN]-[MAX]  messages with a score in the range MIN to MAX *)
       ~z [MIN]-[MAX]  messages with a size in the range MIN to MAX *)

       ~Q              messages which have been replied to
       ~E              expired messages
       ~F              flagged messages
       ~O              old messages
       ~R              read messages
       ~S              superseded messages
       ~U              unread messages
       ~v              message is part of a collapsed thread.

       ~g              PGP signed messages
       ~G              PGP encrypted messages
       ~k              message contains PGP key material

       ~c USER         messages carbon-copied to USER
       ~C EXPR         message is either to: or cc: EXPR
       ~t USER         messages addressed to USER
       ~L EXPR         message is either originated or received by EXPR
       ~l              message is addressed to a known mailing list

       ~h EXPR         messages which contain EXPR in the message header
       ~i ID           message which match ID in the ``Message-ID'' field
       ~x EXPR         messages which contain EXPR in the `References' field

  Where EXPR, USER, ID, and SUBJECT are ``regular expressions''.

  *) The forms <[MAX], >[MIN], [MIN]- and -[MAX] are allowed, too.
