Hey there purple... this rant to you is derivative of a chat I had with
Lou Boon-Kuo late last night. I used to live in a squat with her and it
also happens she's trained up in all this legal stuff we're gonna have to
deal with in the coming days. I'm cc'ing it to her so that if I make any
errors she can spot 'em.

She's offered you the opportunity to chat with her. Her work phone is
92214001 

Anyway. She covered several issues, some involving what we should do
before we show up on April 8th, some involving things that have to be said
in the court by whoever represents you (which is probably a Legal Aid
solicitor). I'm also seeing a Legal Aid solicitor on March 31st, 74
Burwood Road, 4th Floor, between 2 and 3pm.


Pleading
--------
We 'fessed up straight away so we plead guilty; the police have no
subsequent involvement in the case after we plead guilty. The main thing
to think about on this case is the sentence. Under the Inclosed Lands
Protection Act there is nothing that says the Olympic precinct is a
prescribed area (it is not a nursing home, hospital or schoolyard) so if
we get do fined it's probably $550 instead of $1100. Lou reckons we're
aiming for a "Proven but No Conviction" sentence (Sentencing
Procedure Act 1999 section 10) which would be better obviously than a
fine.


Total court time
-----------------
We could go for ages waiting for the case but the actual time it'll take
to hear will be pretty short, about ten minutes.



Minor errors in the Charge Sheet.
----------------------------------
These have no bearing on the outcome of the case but are worthwhile to
mention for accuracy's sake if your legal representative wants to know.

-I actually drove from 441 Darling St Balmain, not from my parent's place
at 7 River St, to your house on Platform St on the day.

-The head torch I used is certainly modified, but is not a miners lamp, as
it carries no OHSA certification for such application (is not flame-proof
or double-insulated for example). It's simply a modified domestic head
torch.

-Detective-Sargeant Campbell mentioned in the charge sheet that "if they
had {sought permission from SOPA}, permission would not have been
granted" {to enter the drains}. Actually, we didn't deliberately not ask
SOPA because we thought they'd refuse access if we did ask - we just never
bothered to ask at all.



Nature of Punishment
---------------------
We spent several hours in police custody for an offense which does not
carry a custodial sentence. We were arrested at about 17:00 in the
afternoon and released at 0:45 the following morning, so the police kept 
us in their custody (cells, police wagons, etc) for almost eight
hours. Lou's take on this is that it could be claimed that punishment has
already been served.


Circumstances
----------------
- Basically we did this 'cos it was a bit of a lark, a subterranean date. 

- I chose this *particular* drain because I used to work in drains in the
  mid 1990s, and when I was at the olympic park precinct in 2000, I
  noticed the access ladders visable through the steel drainage grates and
  became curious to know what was down there.

- This is our first offense for anything.

- We both already mentioned we were remorseful for wasting police time,
  court time, etc, see the charge sheet.

- Here, a little bit about your circumstances. Me: I grew up in
  Blakehurst, completed two science degrees, and do casual computer
  technical work. Have one sibling, and live with / care for elderly
  parents 



Some procedural elements of the hearing
----------------------------------------
-When you go into the court you bow towards the bench (I assume this is
 the big impressive one at the front).

-If you're not already standing you stand when the magistrate comes in.
 Or whenever you're told to stand.

-The magistrate is referred to as `Your Worship'


-When the case is brought before the Magistrate we are asked to plead 
 guilty or not guilty. 


We're pleading guilty so then the hearing turns to the background of the
case, to decide on a sentence. This follows the Crimes (Sentencing
Procedures) act 1999 part 3:


A) Characters involved.
--------------------------------------
- I (or our representative) provide some character references to the
  solicitor & magistrate.
- Criminal Antecedents: this is my first offense.
- I'm still young (33)
- Recent change in longevity, I just got a cancer diagnosis and am
  99% likely to be dead by end of 2008, 80% likely to be dead by end of 2005.
- much of my time is allocated to voluntary activity, mainly tech
  activism; I've been an unpaid system administrator / computer network
  engineer at Catalyst for about seven years.
- mentally competant

(PDF details can be entered in her list)


B) The offense is trivial in its nature 
------------------------------------------ 
-Single offense not compounded by violence/assault on police or property damage
-First offense for each of us
-There is no victim in this crime
-Basically we went somewhere we weren't meant to go and that's all.


C) Extenuating Circumstances
----------------------------
None.


D) Other Matters
------------------------
 - We fully co-operated with the police from the beginning of questioning,
answered all their questions though we weren't obligated to do so, and
admitted guilt straight away.

- Here in the court the first thing we did was plead guilty at the first
possible opportunity - which minimises any additional waste of police
time/court resources.

- we've already expressed remorse about the incident.




Character References.
---------------------
The court likes you to take them seriously and part of this is that they
want to see that you've gone to the effort to call in some evidence
from other people, that you're a contributing member of the community and
other people value you.

These references have to make mention of the fact that they're being
written by a person who has been told of your trespass charge. I'll attach
the quite amazing one Lou wrote me.

They all start off something like:

To the presiding magistrate


...And contain some acknoledgement that the writer knows you got a
trespass charge.

I'm gonna try and get one of the professor who employs me at UNSW and
from some other places.

Three copies, again, for the same people.



Do a CV.
--------
The magistrate (etc) will want some background about both of us. I'm gonna
throw together a brief CV and you probably ought to as well. 

Do three copies of it: one for the Judge/Magistrate, one for your legal
representative, one for you.




We can each pick up a two presentation folders, one to give to the
solicitor and one to the magistrate. Into these, would go copies of

-Paragraph on background: family, study, work, plans, current occupation
       
- resume

- certificates

- char references
