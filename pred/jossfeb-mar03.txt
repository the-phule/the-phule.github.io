Subject: Re: oi there...!

Dear predator,
Hi there! Nice photo. Although I look really stoned.
Probably because I was. 
Sorry I've been out of touch for so long. No excuses
really, except that it's taken the best part of this
year to recover my equilibrium after moving countries.
Being in exile does unexpected things! Some of them
very good -- a new perception of the world, perhaps
for prosaic reasons such as the greyness of the air
and sky and shortness of the days. The sun now sets at
around 4 o'clock. In summer it's the opposite extreme:
sunset is 10pm. Bizarre. 
Do you have a physical, real-world address to which I
can send stuff? I have a couple of postcards I've been
meaning to send you for ages. Being in Bristol, I'm in
very close proximity to Isambard Kingdom Brunel's
(great name that) famous Clifton Suspension Bridge.
What an elegant thing it is. And they have recently
discovered vaults inside the lower section of one of
the stone towers, which was previously thought to be
hollow. I saw the pics and immediately thought of you.
The vaults are closed to the public but no doubt your
cave clan compadres (or their English equivalent, at
any rate) will have no trouble trespassing. Anyway, I
have come to have a newfound appreciation of
suspension bridges. Amazing things. And the SS Great
Britain, which Brunel also designed, is also parked in
the dry dock in Bristol and has its own history of
connections with Australia. Apparently it played a
great part in the transportation of, um, 'migrants' to
the new world. They don't come right out and say it
was a convict ship, of course. 
Anyway, loads of interesting things in Bristol: an
industrial museum, railways, the bridge, the ship. And
it was the birthplace of Thomas Chatterton and Hannah
More. If you ever rethink your position on world
travel I'm sure you'd have a great time here. 
I am working for a magazine company which produces
magazines about sewing and fish, mostly! I proofread
advertisements for them. I wonder if you'll stop
speaking to me now?! Also working several afternoons
and Saturday mornings at a natural health clinic,
where they administer all sorts of nostrums from
acupuncture to hypnosis to kinesiology. I just wrote
an article for my journalism course as to whether
these things work or not. Conclusion: probably not,
but the placebo effect is a powerful thing and not to
be denied. I was chatting to a doctor last night who
told me also about the 'Hawthorne effect', apparently
a similar thing, where the patient feels better merely
by having someone take an interest and pay attention
to them. 
So life goes on in a series of compromises with
capitalism. Not unhappy with the situation. We have
bought a chip shop (of course) and will be converting
it into flats to live in. I'm writing a lot and
finding it very satisfying. And exploring Bristol,
which is just amazing.
So what are you up to? Cave-dwelling? Shagging?
Scientific experiments? What are you reading?
I may be back in Sydney in February for a month. I'll
let you know when I know. 
Love
Jocelyn

Dear All,
My apologies for being incommunicado for so long, it's
been one hell of a year. I'll be able to tell you all
about it in February/March, as I'm back in Sydney from
the 15th of February for a month and I'm looking
forward to seeing all of youse! 
To encapsulate, over the last year I have gained a
stepdaughter, purchased a chip shop, started learning
to be a journalist, been to Glasgow and Edinburgh all
in one day, been to Wales, done a creative writing
course, seen about a hundred movies, read more books
than I can count, nearly lost my sanity (again),
regained it (again), given up smoking dope, given up
drinking (well mostly) and filled four journals with
random scribblings. To top it all off Aaron and I are
getting married tomorrow (Jan 31st and the turn of the
Chinese New Year). I'm sorry you can't all be there
but we'll do it all again sometime and invite
everyone. Wish us luck...I have a raging flu and am a
bit concerned that my glamorous strapless blue dress
isn't quite the thing for the sub-zero temperatures
that pass for weather over here!
Looking forward to seeing you all.

Haven't changed my last name. I realise it's a futile
gesture for feminism given I bear my father's
patronymic anyway, but it's more true than taking
Aaron's ex-stepfather's anyway!
The chip shop is made of potatoes. Sort of like a
gingerbread cottage, like in the fairytales, only with
potatoes. the English version. 
No brain backup unfortunately. lots of notebooks
though.
I'm not eating dope either. I wonder if it really is
less wasteful, given that you have to consume so much
more of it? In any caseit's all academic now, I have
kicked the habit. Mostly!
Didn't see you at thedemo today. Did see John Jacobs,
Suzanne, Kathy Grattan and Stuart. Didn't stay all
thatlong as jetlag prevailed. 
Let me know what you're up to and when you're free for
a coffee.

Dear pred,
It was so lovely to see you last week. I'm back from
Canberra and would love to see a movie with you if
you're free. i rudely went to see the Twin Towers
movie when it came out in England because Aaron
surprisingly wanted to see it, but I would be very
happy to see it again with you. OR we could go and see
Star Trek: Nemesis!! for thatscience fiction fix.
Whaddya say?
Please digout your mobile nuimber and send it to me,
too. I know they are an inconvenience but given I'm
not here long, it would be great to be able to contact
you easily.
Hope you're well

Curioser and curioser. Pray tell.
By the way, I forgot to say how much I am enjoying the
Pinker book. He's a very elegant and witty writer as
well as being y'know, smart n' stuff. I'm only up to
the bit about the Great Eskimo Snow Language Hoax but
it's great so far. Shall endeavour to finish before I
go back. will indoubtedly buy my own copy. /spelling
has fallen by the wayside, this kepyboard is reacting
weirdkly to my gingers(!) andI'm too lazy to go back
and edit. Sure you'll forgive me. 
Nemesis, nemesis, nemesis!! That's great. I don't care
about the critics, what would they know. C'mon guys,
it's Star Trek! We don't care how bad it is, as long
as 7 of 9 is in it in something skin-tight and shiny!
That reminds me, have you seen a porn site called
nakkidnerds.com? If not go there now. Smart, sexy
babes with minimal clothing! You have to subscribe to
see the really raunchy stuff apparently but I thought
thefree pics were worth a loot. A look, a look is what
I meant to say. 
I don't trust those wretched poms with my precious
eyeballs. In any case I like going to Chris McMahon,
been going for years and there's a social aspect and a
sense of continuity that I find reassuring in my
scattered life. Contact lenses cheaper in Australian
dollars too.
Dont' think I need a gas laswer but thanks for asking.
Oh yes, Nemesis. Got distracted. Time, place. Think
it's on at Hoyts Broadway so we could meet at Badde
Manors at 6.30 and eat food before wandering down. No
time available in paper today but there should be one
at 9.30 if not before.
Cones...well I haven't touched 'em for a year. Broke
the addictive cycle so I figured I could afford to
indulgea little. I do love it so!
Mugshots...Aaron wants to see what my friends look
like so he doesn't feel like a ghost. Don't ask. I
wouldn't mind having my own piccie of you any way.
sorry. They're my hostages now! 
Letme know about Tuesday
Love
Joss

Dear predator,
That has to be one of the most beautiful things I have
ever read.
I am not anhonest person, not by a long shot, but I'm
flattered that you, who are so honest yourself, think
so.
You'll never stop being a Catholic, I think. That's
not a jibe. It's a compliment in a funny kind of way.
It's only now that I'm realising how deep the roots of
our behaviour go. How, in acting on a deep unconscious
impulse to misbehave, break the rules, cause trouble,
I was acting on a behaviour pattern that was stamped
into me when I was still soft. It's good to understand
and honour these things.
Maybe I am being honest in confessing to my deep
dishonesty. 
But I'm glad you said no. I'm shuddering to thinkabout
the pain I have already caused you. You kept it from
me, instead of punishing me or confronting me with it.
Thank you for your kindness in doing that, but the
pain must have been twice as bad for it. It always
goes somewhere. 
I am trying to print out a copy, so that when you take
it down I will always have it. Leave it up for a bit
longer, I'm having trouble with my printer.
Sleep well my good friend, and may God(substitute any
other thing of your choice) be with you.
Love
Joss

dear pred
Don't worry, I didn't really take offence. Us gurlz
can be awfully thingy about our weight, despite having
taken all sorts of measures to deprogram ourselves
from such anxieties.
I had a really lovely day. Educational and
entertaining! I find myself wishing I could exist in a
few simultaneous realities so we could still be
lovers. Maybe that'll just have to be the subject for
my first porno experiment.
I don't mind if you're late tomorrow, just as long as
I get to see you.
Lots of love
Joss

Dear pred,
I feel awful, shattered, disintegrated. No doubt due
to ingesting way too much THC and alcohol last night,
but also because I can't bear the thought of leaving. 
But...my friend Michelle said to me the other night:
you can always come back, but you can't always leave.
Not sure if this makes sense or not, but intuitively
it does.
I am going to miss you horribly. Sorry the goodbye was
so brief last night but I couldn't bear to make it
much longer. In half a mind to ask you whether you are
free this evening but another goodbye might just make
this even harder.
All my love
Joss

Yeah, I didn't understand that. It looked like they
were trying to have conversations but how this would
be possible at that volume I don't know.
Whinge whinge. listen to me, I sound like an oldie. I
did feel a bit old last night, but then most of the
people there were probably older than I am. They don't
make whinging old farts like they used to. Speaking of
which, did you get asked for ID? 
I like your circus head comparison. at least they
didn't have their mouths open. That's something I've
always found very disconcerting about those circus
heads. The degree to which the mouth is stretched
combined with the red paint on the lips reminds me of
the way women's mouths look in pornos when they're
giving head. It's not an unsexy look on the right
person but a little strange accompanied by full clown
drag.
My plan for the remaining hours in the country is to
procrastinate about packing some more, and lie on the
couch watching videos of Queer as Folk and Buffy until
my eyes fall out. This way I don't have to think about
leaving. Brilliant!
Love
Joss

Yikes! Who is this Maggie and why is she stalking you?
(I presume it's a woman and not an errant magpie.)
I would never call you at 5.40am. It's very, very rare
if ever that I'm awake at that time of day, and
certainly I'm never in the mood for phone calls before
at least two cups of coffee.
Hope you have a great day with Chloe.

Subject: Re: off again

Hey pred,
Maybe you are hiding, but there's a good reason for it
and when it's time to stop hiding you'll know, I'm
sure. If that time come. It seems to me you have a
good life, though not one I'd really want to live (too
much work for too much mould). Friends, people who
love you, intellectual interests, email buddies to
bemoan the state of the world with, a stalker...
(Shit-I am sorry that my indication of existential
crises caused you to answer the phone thereby alerting
the nutter to your presence there. SHe sounds baaad.
These people can be dangerous so don't take it too
lightly.)
Anyway. I used to have a pessimistic viewpoint about
the state of the earth, the people in it, etcetera,
fairly similar to what I think yours is. All based on
fact and very logical, there's no doubting that.
However, with my bent for taking everything to its
logical extreme, I used this philosophy to come to the
conclusion that I too was worthless, a blight on the
planet, a wasteful sucker of resources who by rights
should not really exist. Now in some respects this is
true, ie as a member of the human race I am vermin,
however it's not easy to reconcile with a functioning
mental state, with life, with pursuing whatever
happiness is available. It's all too common for brainy
idealists like you and me to end up suicidal wrecks or
homicidal maniacs (eg Hitler, only I don't think he
was that brainy). Well, fuck it. I've been
cursed/blessed with life and I either have to use it
properly and enjoy it, or end it. (Interesting, I've
just been reading Interview with a Vampire and these
themes come up quite a lot, unsurprisingly, as they do
in Frankenstein. Oedipal rage, shaking the fist at the
parent/creator: 'How dare you give me life!!' etc.) 
And one of the best ways to keep curious, stay alive
to the world etc is to do big scary challenging things
that break you apart. I could have refrained from
working on moral grounds for the rest of my life,
spent it living with my parents in Balmain...yikes!
But there's a lot about the world, people,
relationships that you just don't find out without
empirical research. So that's why I do what I do.
Better than slashing your wrists!
As for what's on my mind...I miss you. Miss talking to
you and touching you. And I'm becoming so, so
conscious of how easy it is to lose people you love if
you don't make an effort. So this is my effort.
Anyway, the jetlag is probably making me witter on.
Bath and sleep time, I think.
Love
Joss

Dear pred,
This will be short as I have to clean the flat before
the real estate agent comes round. But it's funny. You
say you have things to learn from me but I am
continually made aware that it's the other way around.
You're one of the most considerate people I know,
despite being able to insist on your independence and
your own way of living your life. It's quite a
combination. I think you're fantastic.
