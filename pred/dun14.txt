I'm sorry to be having an argument with you, Ogre.
But hey, I already am with everyone else...

No big detective story, it was known from some time ago.

Also, I recognised the writing style, guessed it was your warning.

Exactly. Do you think he wasn't daring you to, deliberately?
And then so did I. Different effect. As he says, "and so it begins".

I'm guilty (lately).

Hmm.. A very fine hair. I shouldn't have mentioned 'Ogre', and stuck
to flaming 'Mod', to achieve my desired confrontation.

Uh, I distantly recall that suggestion was made, and stood briefly,
till other posts by co-moderators of the time let slip that wasn't
the case, and they had chosen to delete them.
But forget it, issue's been done to death.

I wonder if list moderator or owner have access to a log of list
maintenance activities? Probably asking too much of yahoo.

Yes, I could see that happening, even from the outside.

Of course, we all know that. But they both are components of CC,
and neither should be used to try and control CC. Hence my comment
that the two membership lists (yahoo and expobase) should always
remain the same.

I appreciate that you are much fairer than many could bring themselves
to be. But... you cut someone off for replying sarcasticly to your
announcement that henceforth you'd be cutting people off.
And an easy example to make.

How about you reconsider?
