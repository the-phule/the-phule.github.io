cat was sick yesterday. not responding at all from about 11pm thursday.  
one of the disks died, the oldest one that was serving as the boot disk. i
just fixed it tonight. i threw out the old disk. luckily we had a backup
of it's contents on the new 6 gig disk (i started nightly disk mirroring
last week, before that we were only backing up the web site!).

i tried using it as an opportunity to complete the system upgrade (to
debian 2.1) but failed trying to convert the postgresql database contents
across. so i did some juggling and restored the old redhat system just as
it was ... presumably as of Thu 6am. 

anyway, cat is happy and eveything seems to be working.

it does leave the question now of how we back up the new disk contents. i
suggest we get another 6 gig disk and do nightly mirrors onto that.

unfortunately in the juggling i dropped some crucial debian 2.1 files, so
i decided to wipe the debian 2.1 install completely. we'll need to start
again on that one, sorry.

as far as deciding the disk was dead, i tried swapping various IDE cables
around, and i am quite certain that the first disk was the only broken
piece of equipment. it was also making dodgy noises.

cheers,
m.
