Conway has an ATX power supply, which is a marvel of engineering with one
stupid drawback when used in the permanent-on situation - when fed mains
and the on/off switch is turned on, it won't immediately supply power to
the motherboard, peripherals, etc. It wants you to press a button to
activate it. Come on, it's a power supply, the idea is, when you feed it
juice and it feeds you juice. When is the operative word.

To get around this: 
- turn off, remove mains
- bridge wires to pins 14 and 15; insulate.
- connect motherboard, peripherals.
- feed mains power to supply, watch things turn on.

This enables the supply to function immediately the instant mains power is
fed to it, like they used to in the good old days of AT power supplies
which weren't too smart for their own good.
