<H3> Catalyst Hardware </H3>

Catalyst services are run on a bunch of machines which were either
donated, scavenged, or built up from parts from either of these sources.
<P>
<B> Why we use PCs <B>
We use the PC as our platform not because it is elegant, efficient or we
like Intel, but because of certain practical aspects: there are zillions
of PC's being discarded every year and the availability of cheap
replacement parts is very good. We need to have some functioning boxes
standing by so if something blows up we can replace it fast.
<P>
<B> The box <B>
Cat's server is currently (March 2001) a Intel Pentium running at 200MHz,
and it sits in a nondescript clone motherboard, in a standard AT minitower
case. 
<P>
The server has a pair of 72pin RAM slots (each of which has a 32Mb SIMM in
it) and three 168pin RAM slots, two of which have a DIMM in them, one 16Mb
and the other 32Mb. 
<P>
<B>Plug'n'Puke</B>
The motherboard has some ISA slots and some PCI slots, in which sit our
ancient NE2000 network card and VGA card, both of which were probably
snarfed from Ernie's Charity Recycling or donated by various Cat members
of associates. We plan to fling the NE2000 and stick in a PCI equivalent
sometime soon. Probably 3C595 100baseT or something like that.
<P>
<B>Significant Little Stuff</B>
Every year or so we replace the power supply fan, which, since it moves
millions of cubic feet of office air per year, tends to seize with dust if
not replaced or cleaned. Generally this happens around December.
<P>
The reset switch and on/off switches on the front panel are disconnected
or hidden within the case, prevent accidental shutdowns. CTRL-ALT-DEL has
been reprogrammed to give a message : "Please don't press that button
again."
<P>
<B> Reliable Juice </B>
Treehuggers (the machine which is our gateway at TWS) and Purple, the
catalyst webserver are both backed by a TPS uninterruptable power supply,
which was scavenged off the roadside by Joey of Ten-Twelve sometime in
2000. The UPS will run both machines (without their monitors) and the
local 16port hub for at least half an hour in the event of a power outage.
<P>
<B>Spinning Storage and the meaning of MTBF</B>
There are three harddisks in purple.cat at the moment; two by Quantum -
one is 6Gb and the other is 9Gb (which, amongst other things, has the
nightly backup of the 6Gb drive on it) and an old Maxtor 540Mb item.
<P>
For improved cooling they are not positioned exactly next to each other.
Since these drives run 24h a day, all year, they clock up about 8700 hours
of operation per annum.
<P>
It is probably a good idea to replace them *well before* their mean time
between failure has elapsed. This varies from drive to drive. If we look
at the specs on the Quantum Website for the 6Gb and 9Gb drives which we
have, they usually have a mean time between failure of about 600,000 hours
- well over sixty years - in the field. This figure is a mathematical
fudge: it's an artefact of taking say, 600 harddisks and running them for
1000 hours and noticing that during the accumulated 600,000 of harddisk
operation, only one harddrive failed. 600,000 hours is a little less than
70 years, which is a period significantly longer than harddisk technology
has existed 8-). They don't state if the test drives are just left turned
on or if they do continuous head seeks and heavy I/O with them. 
<P>
It's a "mean" value, so you can derive from it a probability, and a
confidence interval, that a given harddisk of the type tested will die
after n hours of operation. There is a good page at 
<A HREF=http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/apr/section4/apr451.html>
The Engineering Statistics Handbook </a> concerning how confident you can
be that something like a harddisk will die, if it has such-and-such an
MTBF.
<P>
I expect we can get about three years of rock-solid reliable use out of
these devices before we relegate them to non-critial tasks. Cat had an
stochastic harddisk death in Nov98 (?) which resulted in the institution
of the current nightly backup regime. If we lose one harddisk everything
is still there on the other one. A better plan would be to FTP mirror it
to another box.

Anyway, so much for harddisks.
