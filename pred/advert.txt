Predator,
Firstly allow me to clarify my position. The excessive qty. of ads. found
on most if not all forms of media (Have you seen the new ones on taxi
hub-caps) annoy me. But I also understand that my favorite dirtbike mag
can not be sold at the very reasonable price of $6.95 without this
advertising content. I could bore you with more positive aspects of
advertising but we have covered this area sufficiently.

Ahaa. using a much broader definition of the term parasite than I
anticipated. None the less still quite a small portion of our time is
spent deterring parasites. >

I am having difficulty understanding your meaning in the above paragraph,
as I read it
<analogue mode on>
* Puppy has fleas.
* Puppy spends 20% of waking time scratching. Even if a bit busy, all is
well.
* Fleas increase population causing puppy to spend 30% of waking time
scratching. A bit busier but all is still well.
* Fleas jump ship to kitten.
* Puppy withers and dies due to not being able to forseeably maintain his
own viability without the fleas.

My reading list is clearly vastly different to yours and Diode's, I am
familiar with all the terms in the above section but I am making no sense
of it. I assume some prior knowledge is required.

I agree, we should aim to be a symbiote on earth but in my view the
infinite greed of humanity is a huge barrier.

Fortunately my parents did not shovel religion down my throat. The "if I
am a good little serf copping a regular shafting with a smile on my face
because god loves me, I will die prematurely and have a joyous afterlife"
mindset annoys the crap out of me.

The rivers of money attract a government tax, so theoretically the wider
and deeper the river the better for the government and therefore the
community. This is a very simplistic view but you get my point.

You say CocaCola could stop advertising for a month. But still they spend
millions each month, are you suggesting they are merely being charitable
to the advertising industry.

Correct, their product is not all socially beneficial. Because it is not
supposed to be, no producer of advertising material would attempt to say
it is. But none the less I am still informed of products which could make
my life easier or better (along with a large quantity of crap) and product
manufacturers can concentrate on producing their product be it a
worthwhile product or crap.

How much would it cost without the advertising??
