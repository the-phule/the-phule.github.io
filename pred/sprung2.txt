Yep, we thought it was you ;). Anybody trying to hack you is out of their
mind in my opinion, you certainly know your stuff. As it turns out, it was
his undoing in the end.

You provided the missing link. The times in which he was doing the hacking,
and from what IP. Us finding his account logged in at that time, on that
machine with that IP, and him admitting he was logged in at that time, is
all we needed. That's the nail in the coffin. As I mentioned, we've had
evidence on this guy before, but he just denied it, and we were left with
no way to prove otherwise.

He's not the smartest guy around. Initially we tracked him because his
proxies he was running on our machines last year were logging everything he
was doing. He forgot to untick the box 'Log File' in his little
application. From there we worked out where he was, which ultimately led to
us getting his student number and address.

It turned nasty when he went from running proxy servers and system shut
down timers from one other student's account, to cracking other accounts.
Our admin accounts were some of them. This he would have done via somehow
installing services on our machines that logged keys or sniffed packets.
This was all around 6 months ago, and since we couldn't prove anything
concrete, we just had to make our systems more secure (which was the only
good outcome of the whole thing). Since then, he has only been able to run
his applications from his own student account. Once he was logged out, the
app stopped running.

As for how he cracked your passwords, well it's hard to say. I've only
noticed one instance of a machine left logged in running a key logger. Have
you possibly used a PC in the lab that was already logged in without
logging them out? I would imagine he'd target the tutor machines mainly.

Oh by the way, well spotted on the 'indonesian' thing. He is indonesian ;).

Thanks again,

Congratulations - good on ya guys! Persistence pays off. Need a formal
written stat dec about this? Just ask.

Yeah, Mike Carlton's my real name. Don't be fooled by the drive-time AM
radio shock-jock of the same cognomen. Tall, blond-haired, blue-eyed,
black boots and no sense of decorum whatsoever? Yep, that's me.

Hmmm. I expect he won't be coming back to .175 rapidly. Did you actually
get a real-world ID on the person in question?  Hmmm. May have other
machines similarly doing his bidding if he's been doing this stuff for as
long as you say.

What?! Isn't my bad Darth Vader voice impersonation good enough?
"Crash the network, Luke. It is your dessss-tiny!"     8-)

Seriously tho, yeah, good on you all for keeping your eyes open and
nabbing the chap... none of you need this hassle. Glad to help you out!


I'm curious to know how he cracked me - sniffer? Keylogger?
