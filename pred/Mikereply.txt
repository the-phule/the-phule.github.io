The planet-wide convention for intercalated responses is what you're

Someone's obviously heard about all the cell cultures that were lost in
1998 at Prince Henry Hospital, when all the freezers got power cut by
workmen. Lot of time and energy bound up in those freezer cultures.

There were a few little y2k blips and nothing major, to my considerable
relief. Whilst I think the simultaneity threat is over, there are
probably gonna still be little problems (like in new code slammed into
production, old batch jobs etc) but we won't hear about them. I still
don't think the code is fixed, but I do think society will stay functional
for a while yet.

Hookup. heh, nice term.

I managed (a bit tenuously at times) for 26 years of my life without a
mate (was getting a bit paranoid about being irredeemably unattractive or
something). There's really no need to bow to the social pressure, I think
hookups have to be an internally driven decision - something you arrive at
yourself. Some of my best female friends are hooked up with other women
and quite happily so. Some people are not hooked up at all, and they
seem to get along fine but they seem to be in the minority, humans seem
to need or want varous partnerships, we're social animals. I've never
hooked up with a guy, i don't know about that dynamic at all.

yes, but which of course presumes the requirement for kids, which a lot of
people get along fine without too - but geez, the people who want them and
can't have them (infertility, etc) really get agonised, so I guess the
drive is pretty strong for some.

It makes sense that women pick mates with lots of resources which can be
poured into their children, and in an biological advantage sense this is 
a hard argument to go against. I think one should be resigned about this,
it just makes sense, there's no point being bitter about it, and if he is
it suggests to me that maybe he's feeling a bit inadequate or something,
which is fine, but he hasn't evolved mechanisms to cope with it, which
isn't fine. Do I care if my DNA gets passed on? No.

I think this depends how much of your own money you have. Starvation is a
powerful motivator, but that's down at the extreme bottom end of the
scale.

There is such a thing as the "trophy wife" - you see the rich old
executives in their fifties with these blonde tanned young women in their
20s, and have thoughts about the fundamental nature of the relationship -
money buying looks. I think it works for women too, but I haven't heard
the term "trophy husband" yet.

No, it's the subsequent unfulfilled fantasies that turn people into
frustrated, paranoid-about-their-own-shortcomings, unhappy individuals.
Gotta go generating coping mechanisms for this.

I really don't know. I've heard it used in so many different connotations, 
I think the word has been emptied of usable meaning.

I don't think there is a gradient, the two emotions are totally different,
but since they tend to occur concurrently, they are confused as one and
the same. We're wired to do love and lust, and I'm not sure which one is
the predominant urge, but I bet lust is the ringleader. 

To answer the question, however, I'll resort to my usual blunt, tasteless
and brutally effective scientific method; to distinguish between lust and
love, ask yourself if you like the *person* just _after_ you've experienced
an orgasm (not necessarily with the person in question, either.) Since the
lust component is effectively shut down for a little while, one can see in
the clear light of intellect and judge without bias if you like
interacting with the personality or simply interacting with the carcass it
is wrapped in.

(Mike thinks, hmmm, Yam's just read this and is thinking "Sorry I asked.")
Sorry, I don't mean to sound too off colour, but I think the method works.

>Of course when you are in love with someone, you also are attracted to

It's crazy, isn't it - love (whatever it is) turns normal, rational human
beings into drooling hornbags! I suspect this is part of the anaesthetic
which slows down our reason enough for long enough to let people get
carnally entangled and reproduce the species.

To a first approximation he's right. There are other cases. Guys who
haven't had sex before probably would like to have sex (ask *any* bloke
who has admitted to never having had the experience, we're all curious!).
Some guys are interested in personalities rather than shagging (eg: lonely
old men). There's a spectrum.

Game theory for a two-component interaction suggests:
1) guys who want to shag women and don't care about their personalities
2) guys who want to shag women and who do care about their personalities
3) guys who don't want to shag women and who don't care about personalities
4) guys who don't want to shag and who do care about their personalities

and then there's the whole broad scope of sex, and what goes on in that
theatre of human interaction, so whereas some blokes want what they want,
ensure they get it and don't care what the partner wants, other blokes do
actually exhibit basic consideration, enquire what their prospective
partner likes, etc. I think most humans, sexual beings which they are, 
would like sex but what that entails varies for different people and the
only way to get it mutually enjoyable is for both parties to chat to each
other about it. I certainly don't think it should be forced on someone who
doesn't want it.

>Though on reflection, what he said wasn't really earth shattering.

I think everyone's gotta be able to know that when they say "stop"
then the other person will actually stop, that sort of thing. 

>importantly just because you sleep with a guy (in the literal sense of

Correct. There's always sleeping (zzz) and sleeping (xxx), people do both,
it's normal, so what. I don't care what people do either way, it isn't
really any of my business, I hope if they sleep they sleep well, f they
shag they enjoy it.

>And besides, there are other ways you can entertain yourselves other than

Yeah, yeah, I know that too. From what some of my flames have told me
about their previous experiences, I think some of their previous partners
need a bit of education about that. Long, close naked hugs are a
favourite, massage is yummy, etc etc etc, though yeah, sex is pretty good,
too.

>Am I on a quest? Do I act like I am on a quest?

I dunno. And so what if you are? You're asking questions, standard human
practise, I don't assume you're after some sort of holy grail, I don't
think you're gullible enough to think there's a Mr/Ms Right out there -
but there are plenty of Mr/Ms Fairly Goods and Mr/Ms Quite Adequates -
we're all humans, and all feel the same urges to a greater or lesser
extent.

>Please please please don't tell me that I look desperate! 

I think you don't, but what do I know? Remember you're asking me, 
Mr-dressed-like-a-derelict, to detect any subtle outward signs of
desparation in you. From the perspective of someone who dresses like a
total dero, I'd only say looks are nevertheless sometimes misleading, or
represent only part of a person's entire picture, and they often fool a
lot of people. Curiosity and desparation are not the same beast.

Really we just don't know. I don't know if it'd be appropriate to ask
them about it, either. Time will reveal all.

*ahhhhh!*

I'm happy for them, and I'd be mildly worried if they weren't. No shame in
it.

I suspect this is a fair call. I do think that a lot of parents failed to
learn from their own upbringings and repeat the failures of the people who
parented them. All tricky stuff.

Thanks for replying. Hope it's useful. Still wanna meet'n'eat or something?
