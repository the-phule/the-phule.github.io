Ah, no, I should have been more specific. Reading it again, I see it
does come over that way. Sorry. I read your SMS as a comment on
all the info that has been passed around, and _maybe_ that you also
knew of some factor I didn't. Anyway, I agree - they either know, or
are really really slack.
The big question now is - do they care, and have the owners got some
spare cash to do anything about it?
We can find an answer to that one if we are careful.

You may write very heated emails late at night, but I'd never suspect
you of deliberately doing something more harmful.

Lets just stop here with the assurance I didn't suspect you of that,
so I'll skip...

I know you intend well, and are primarily concerned that this all
work out well. I disagree with your opinons of one person, and
that you were so insistent on them being a menace to all, and your
mode of response to my attempts to argue the point.

Ah, no, I took it as unwillingness to stick to the original 'trusted'
criteria. But no point beating that anymore.
The 'elitism' digs in my spoof, were because we set ourselves up as
an elite, and proceeded to behave as elites do. So easy to get carried
away...

You actually seemed to agree to his inclusion at an early point, then
dug in again when F & S turned out to be so insistently opposed.

I suggest (again) you get over your opinion of them, go on an expo
to this place with them, and learn that you were exaggerating your
fears. Hey, he'll probably even forgive you for being such a wuss.

>and have fun exploring with him. Given that at least two of my 
>friends were firmly vetoed by your good self, an exclusion I took 

Huh? I don't recall suggesting vetoing anyone? I went along with
some vetos I should not have (Milsey, Rodent) even added an item to
Rodent's 'sins'. And am now ashamed of those. Those people are free
to kick me next time they meet me.
I recall making a negative comment about one other person, who I
also thought might be a risk (for different reasons), but saying
I was happy to include them anyway.
There was Hatchet (we all agreed his medical condition would be
dangerous to him and therefore others in such a place, but he should
decide), and um... did we wonder if Ogre might have a problem with
the physical effort required? Can't recall.
There were quite a few names I simply forgot on my list, which you
guys added.
Um. Could you remind me, privately?
And I _do_ respect private emails, but 'to all' isn't private.
You might have thought about that before pressing send.

A bit silly to demand someone cease doing what they haven't done for
some time? And 'drunkard' is an exageration. Some of your emails were
rather 'blurry', for want of a better description. Late night? Anger?
Pissed? I've no idea.
Saying things like "I could demolish your emotional and irrational
arguments, but couldn't be bothered because you are too thick to understand"
(words to that effect) is not an endearing debating tactic.

>that Fenix is a thief, 

You are raising that matter again - and I said it was the first thing
I'd 'censor'.

>and that I or we are planning to get other members of the clan arrested.

A rumour, not refering to you, that I felt I had to take seriously.
Sad though it was. I'll get around to tracking that one back (or finding
if it was just a bad smell), when things have calmed down.

> You have no evidence for 
>any of these claims and as it happens every one of them is wrong. 

Hmmm, some of them you are putting in my mouth,
other ones... well... its a mess. Hard to know what to do.

Think I'll do some woodwork. Power planes make less racket than this.
