Do you run any in which the prime activity of the group is
doing illegal things?
It makes a *big* difference to the list's necessary function,
and hence acceptable range of modes of operation.

'not easy', 'being fair', and so on, all assume an _active_
moderator. Which in general we have not previously required.
I'd argue in fact, that an active moderator cannot help but
do things which are not going to work in a group such as this,
where consequences of major group divisions are not abstract,
but can have very real and harmful effects (as in, with the law.)

>So for starters, I'd like to say LAY OFF the moderator, and show some respect.

Respect is earned, and only maintained by careful action.
No doubt I'm losing a lot at the moment, but I've considered
that in my choice of actions. So must the Mod.

ahem... its getting convoluted, isn't it? I'm arguing because I
didn't like the argumentative behaviour of others, which made
some dammed good exploring problematical. For now.

It should, because the Clan has to have a discussion list. There are
not, and never will be, any regular meetings of all the members.
The question is not whether the list should exist, but who is going to
go to the trouble of running it. Assuming that yahoo rules allow
for 'ownership' to be transfered, it doesn't have to shut down
if and when the current owner gets sick of the trouble.

Please think carefull about the implications of a discussion group
for illegal activities, before acting.
