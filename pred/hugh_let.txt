Subject: [imc-sydney] Proposal to Spend: AV digitising card for new IMC
    computer?

COMMENTS PLEASE:

Cat@lyst, which provides the technical basis (computers and web-hosting) for the
Independent Media Centre, wants to buy a nifty audio/video editing computer so 
that users of the IndyMedia Centre can edit, digitise, and upload to the IMC
website. 

A Pentium III 800MHz MMX on a MSI motherboard with 128M RAM, a 30Gig 7200rpm 
hard drive, a 17" Hyundai .25" dot pitch monitor, a floppy drive and an AKA ATX 
Meditower case and power supply is $1700. With a CD burner this will use all 
of the available CAT money. (CAT is currently paying $200/month for 
Internet access).

About $500 dollars more is needed to supply an Osprey audio/video card. Do we 
think this would be an appropriate use of funds? Comments please. 

I believe the IMC account has about $1500. (Sam: could you confirm this?)

cheers,
hugh trevelyan
