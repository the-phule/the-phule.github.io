Ah, but then the thing wouldn't have happened to you in the
first place, because no one would treat Vic's wishes with
such dismissive rudeness.
So easy for you to say.

So its either put them up untouched, or not at all?
And these 'private emails' are all 'reply to all' in a group of six,
discussing a major find and expo. Thats not private at all.

Maybe I should send you the complete set, and let you decide if I

Apart from a couple of accidental 'send to' that were meant to
be 'send to all' (and did then get resent to all) there are no
private emails in there.
Still grumbling?

And if this means no one ever trusts me to participate in some
'secret planning group' ever again, well *good*.
It was such a huge mistake in the first place, even if it did
seem like a good idea at the time.
