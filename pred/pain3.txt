Thanks for the effort, but we;re still being bled. Yes, indeed, any
experienced or interested DNS config people we'd be happy to have you
along for the fun and games.

Are we noticing something here? We do an upgrade and critical things break
next time they are started. This happened for the mail system at last
conway downtime, and also broke the nightly backup script ('cos updated
tar wanted J not I as the flag for bz2). 

The first time we get ollie on a fast connection, we
spend three hours doing a dist-upgrade, and *this* breaks DNS config by
making it mega-greedy for bandwidth?

This is currently using a meg every 27 minutes or so, and at 20c a meg on
that line this is ripping the bux out faaast, it needs fixing as soon as
we can figure out how to do it. That's aboout $70 a week.

I think perhaps we should invoke dist upgrades much more carefully.
Apt-get is a double edged sword, what it gives in convenience it naturally
takes away in safety, like most useful tools.


Hoe-in DNS heads.
