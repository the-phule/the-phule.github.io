Subject: What was the cracker doing?


Hi Geoff. Good to chat to you today. 

There is no evidence from my bash_history that there was anything really
deliberately malicious that the chap was doing to cat.org.au. To my
awareness he never did anything which was designed to hide log entries
(hence we have a lot of them) or modify/delete files, add backdoors to
daemons, install a rootkit, grab the password file, etc. There was some
anomalous behaviour on conway (mainly lockouts and crashes, it had been up
for at least a month prior to that) correlating with the unauthorised
activity and possibly some lossage of stuff on /usr but that was all
backed up on an unmounted spun-down harddisk. Still... this inconvenienced
me and several other people.


----------
Auth.logs

Here's some analysis of the auth.log on conway, for the day that I locked
your cracker out of the machine here at Turella, conway.cat.org.au. He
did, it appears, try and log in again several times after I changed the
password.

The auth.logs don't care about tty entries, since they're not invoked from
the network, and are assumed to be authorised at a physical level (if you
can get to a keyboard, you probably own the machine anyway.)

These are the auth.log entries for the day I logged him out, with
commentaries:

root@conway:~# grep 129.94 /home/predator/auth.log | grep 129.94



>Feb 26 00:26:39 conway sshd[27174]: Could not reverse map address
>129.94.222.175.
>Feb 26 00:26:41 conway sshd[27174]: Accepted password for predator from
>129.94.222.175 port 2101

That's the unauthorised chap logging in 15 minutes before I arrived
locally at the server. I arrived about fifteen minutes later, at twenty
minutes to one in the morning, initially logged in from tty4.

It happens that when I'm in the same room, I normally log in to conway,
from an adjacent machine, tarvat.cat.org.au (192.186.2.1) which is our
NAT/firewall/router box. That I logged into conway at conway's terminal at
all, was a consequence of conway's process allocation being so completely
monopolised by the hajar executable, and the network bandwidth between
conway and tarvat (10mbit/sec) being so saturated that ssh authentication
was taking forever to complete, so I changed chairs, powered up conway's
monitor and logged in there directly. I ran top -qi, and shortly after
that point I kill -9'd ed the hajar executable (bringing loadavg back to
something respectable - most of the utilisation LEDs on the DE-1600 hub
then went dark - all of them were lit solid when I arrived).

Then I ran w, looked at the originating IPs and then killed all of the
bash shells from 129.94.222.175, which presumably killed the psyBNC mIRC
proxy if it was running at all (maybe it never was invoked). 



I then logged in from several other virtual terminals on conway and tried
and figure out where the heck this 129.94 machine was, hence this entry
below. My account (predator) is superuser capable and any superuser
privelages used via sudo are logged, such as the following entry from me
on the morning:


>Feb 26 00:41:25 conway sudo: predator : TTY=tty4 ; PWD=/home/predator ;
>USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/sbin/traceroute 129.94.222.175


Here below, in this entry, he tries to log in again.  PuTTY.exe likes to
try to reverse-lookup DNS entries first so the client can be
name-identified before permitting access, but I think this doesn't happen
because these UNSW numbers don't have assocated DNS entries anyplace.

>Feb 26 02:34:15 conway sshd[3712]: 
>Could not reverse map address 129.94.222.175.
>Feb 26 02:34:20 conway sshd[3712]: Failed password for predator from
>129.94.222.175 port 2163


He tries again about a minute later....

>Feb 26 02:35:38 conway sshd[3712]: Failed password for predator from
>129.94.222.175 port 2163

Then again nine seconds later....

>Feb 26 02:35:45 conway sshd[3712]: Failed password for predator from
>129.94.222.175 port 2163


I think at this point he's decided the PuTTY session is broken (and maybe
his IRC proxy is not working anymore either) so he invokes PuTTY again,
and the reverse DNS entry request fails again:

>Feb 26 02:36:18 conway sshd[3798]: Could not reverse map address
>129.94.222.175.
>Feb 26 02:36:26 conway sshd[3798]: Failed password for predator from
>129.94.222.175 port 2172

... and he tries again, with a new session, nearly three minutes later....

>Feb 26 02:39:28 conway sshd[3901]: Could not reverse map address
>129.94.222.175.
>Feb 26 02:39:35 conway sshd[3901]: Failed password for predator from
>129.94.222.175 port 2188

... and again 4 seconds later in the same session.

>Feb 26 02:39:39 conway sshd[3901]: Failed password for predator from
>129.94.222.175 port 2188


I think he finally gets the idea that he's locked out after six attempts.

There are no other entries from that machine.

By 3:25am the email you got on Thurs 26th Feb was on its way to Graham
Low. It was also posted to catgeek, a mailman list where the admin on
cat.org.au post tech discussions to each other. One of the other root
admin here, Andy, read the posting not long after, and did what I did -
portscanned the machine in question:


>Feb 26 03:47:43 conway sudo:  andy : TTY=pts/2 ; PWD=/spare/backups ;
>USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/nmap -sS 129.94.222.175


That's everything of relevance to 129.94.222.175 from Feb 26's
auth.logs.

Earlier auth.logs contain the following:

Feb 16 13:38:47 conway sshd[9054]: Accepted password for predator from 129.94.222.105 port 4920
Feb 16 13:54:50 conway sshd[10156]: Accepted password for predator from 129.94.222.105 port 4986
Feb 16 14:22:54 conway sshd[12410]: Accepted password for predator from 129.94.222.105 port 1090
Feb 16 14:26:05 conway sshd[12679]: Accepted password for predator from 129.94.222.105 port 1131 ssh2
Feb 16 14:30:19 conway sshd[13087]: Accepted password for predator from 129.94.222.105 port 1132 ssh2

(the fun probably starts below here...)
Feb 18 13:15:45 conway sshd[18185]: Accepted password for predator from 129.94.222.177 port 2018
Feb 19 18:56:47 conway sshd[11154]: Accepted password for predator from 129.94.222.175 port 4873
Feb 20 16:10:20 conway sshd[13291]: Accepted password for predator from 129.94.222.175 port 2362
Feb 20 16:41:04 conway sshd[19611]: Accepted password for predator from 129.94.222.175 port 2551
Feb 21 13:29:33 conway sshd[10488]: Accepted password for predator from 129.94.222.175 port 2912

Then .... did nothing until the 26th as far as I can tell.

------------------------
conway syslogs

I was wondering if some invokations of pine in my bash_history entries
that day were invoked by him looking at emails he'd managed to send to
himself (well, to me) but this appears to not be the case.

The syslogs for the 23rd to the 26th (chop-off day) have four entries
pertinent to 129.94 addresses:

Feb 26 06:43:56 conway qmail: 1077738236.012945 
tcpserver: pid 6978 from 129.94.12.209
Feb 26 06:44:25 conway qmail: 1077738265.105903 
tcpserver: pid 7007 from 129.94.12.209

These above correlate with the two messages from Graham Low to you (Geoff)
and I, which left UNSW timestamped at 06:41:53 AM and 06:42:23 am.

Feb 23 17:06:27 conway qmail: 1077516387.618695 
tcpserver: pid 6274 from 129.94.12.209
Feb 23 19:16:18 conway qmail: 1077524178.101642 
tcpserver: pid 14297 from 129.94.12.209

These two also check out to emails I recieved from Graham which left UNSW
timestamped at 17:04:36 and 19:14:18 on their respective days. Graham must
be working long days!

Again, the timestamps are accurate. These are out-of-normal-hours SMTP
connections from notesmta.commerce.unsw.edu.au, and noteworthy because of
their odd times, but otherwise check out. 

Other entries in earlier parts of the syslog correlate to other legitimate
postings I recieved from Graham Low, Shane Stevens' cse account, late
submissions from GENC5001 students Peter Koh and Kim Warner, and also a
posting from Joe Wolfe in the UNSW physics department. So I suspect if
your cracker has an 0wn3d email account anyplace in UNSW which he wanted
to test, he didn't test it by sending things to predator@cat.org.au then
deleting them.

------------------------
conway snort logs.

The snort logs for conway.cat.org.au indicate nothing from 129.94.222.175
for all of February. As far as snort is concerned, the chap had a legit
passwd/account combo (mine) so was legitimately logging in.

-----------------------
Conway /var/log/messages

is, with respect to 129.94 numbers, completely mundane but has a UNSW
machine on an IP number I don't associate with UNSW. 

zgrep unsw messages.1.gz 

gets me this :

I don't know if this is of relevance.



-----------------------
The port 51 exploit:

The C code which was compiled on conway and launched without authorization
as an executable from my account is attached below. Output appeared to be
sent to stderr (not a file). Targetted machines were:

>   196  ./hajar 80.144.184.19 51&
This appears to be a machine somewhere in Europe, on t-dialin.net, via
sprintlink in Germany. It thinks it is called p5090b813.dip.t-dialin.net.
That port is currently filtered, the service is la-maint

>   255  ./hajar 202.159.50.17 51&
This is a machine in Indonesia, probably several hops into indo.net.id; 
It thinks it is called mma-ip-017.indo.net.id
Port 51 on that machine is currently closed.
 

>   319  ./hajar 202.155.38.120 51&
This looks to be an indosat.net machine reachable via INTER.NET's
Indonesian satellite gateway. Port 51 on that machine is currently closed.


>   364  ./hajar 203.173.147.137 51&
This is a machine under the administration of ihug, Sydney.
It thinks it is called p137-tnt8.syd.ihug.com.au
It is also running la-maint in filtered mode, and is blocking ping probes.

la-maint is apparently a logical address maintainer for IMP. I am not sure
what the significance of this is, now how he chose his numbers.

I just now un-froze this as he compiled it, and ran it thus:

predator@conway:~/   $hajar 192.168.2.3 51

It says:

Pasukan..!!!! Tembaaaak 192.168.2.3 ke port 51


If invoked with & at the end it will run in background. While hajar _is_
running in background,

predator@conway~:sudo lsof | grep hajar 

gets this:

hajar     27794 predator  cwd    DIR       3,66     4096     327141 /home/predator/

The second last line is interesting and correlates with the output of
trafshow (not shown here) while hajar runs in the background. It sends a
LOT of UDP traffic at port 51 of the target machine from ports in the
420xx range. It eats about 94% of the available CPU effort while it runs
in order to do this.

Here's the ifconfig stats - check the loop interface (the attack is
launched over the loop interface during this investigation

lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
          RX packets:23776994 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:23776994 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
          RX bytes:2655499384 (2.4 GiB)  TX bytes:2655499384 (2.4 GiB)

Let's check them again exactly one minute later

lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
          RX packets:26533212 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:26533212 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

          RX bytes:2895290404 (2.6 GiB)  TX bytes:2895290404 (2.6 GiB)



So... conway's 94% busy running this script, and in 60 seconds has
generated approx 640 megabytes of UDP packets containing whatever this
script is attempting to do.

Invoking it at our firewall just now:

./hajar 192.168.2.1 51&

reproduces the `All hub utilisation lights on' phenomenon which brought
all this to my attention in the first place.


No wonder conway wasn't paying attention to my attempts to log in!

The other thing which he presumably intended to run was the psyBNC IRC
proxy - probably in line with proxies he runs on Windows machines on
campus.


Here's the blurb, via Google.

   Introduction

   If you know nothing about bncs, a bnc is short for a 'bouncer.' A bnc
   acts as a proxy for irc, allowing you to hide your real IP address and
   use a vhost (vanity host - something like 'this.is.a.l33t.vhost.com').
   What are the advantages of this? Well, mainly there's just one
   important one: It'll stop stupid packet kiddies from trying to knock
   you off the network. Everyone hates getting disconnected, and with a
   bnc on a decent shell, you should be pretty immune. Remember though:
   the kiddies can still nuke you, but it is assumed that the shell
   provider has a high-bandwidth line that allows it to withstand the
   numerous packets. If your shell is on a 56.6, you'll still be screwed.

----------
----------
We're on a 512Mbit/sec incoming DSL link. So if someone was trying to
knock this chap off we'd be fielding a lot of incoming packets!
----------
----------


   So... why psybnc? There are a variety of other open source bnc's
   available for you to download, most notably EZBounce and plain-ol BNC.
   Both of these do the exact same basic thing as psybnc: hide your real
   host. But that's about where the similarity ends. I've been using psy
   for a long time now, and I love with all the features that it offers.
   To name a few:
    You'll always be connected to irc. Even when you close your irc
   client, psy will maintain your connection. When you connect later,
   you'll instantly be back on the channels you left. This also lets you
   hold your nick (if you need that feature), or hold ops on a channel.
    psy hides your IP even in DCC sessions. In other bncs, a direct
   client-client session is opened, thus revealing your IP. In psy, the
   connection is bounced through the shell, and your IP remains your
   dirty little secret ;)

----------
----------
Well, not if it's someone elses ;-)
----------
----------


    You can link multiple psy's together. This allows you to share
   vhosts, and also create a small ircd, termed the 'internal' network on
   the bncs.
    psyBNC now supports SSL. woohoo :)))

   There are tons more features, but you can just download the source and
   view the README.

   Now... for the first part of this tutorial, the Basic section, I
   assume you have little or no experience with shells/irc. For the
   Intermediate section, though, I assume you can hold your own. For most
   users, the Basic is as far as they need to go, but all the fun stuff
   is a bit more complicated.


   Configuring and Compiling

   Hopefully you have already downloaded the source. If not, you can find
   it here: http://www.psychoid.lam3rz.de. After you have downloaded

----------
----------
Yes, actually that's exactly where he downloaded it from. Maybe he read
this same tutorial?
----------
----------


   that, fire up your favorite ftp client and upload it to the root
   directory of your shell. You could also get the source by using lynx
   or wget. Example wget command:
   wget http://www.psychoid.lam3rz.de/psyBNC2.3.1.tar.gz

----------
----------
This is *precisely* the command he used.
----------
----------

   The next step is to decompress this file (.tar.gz is kinda like a .zip
   file for all you windoze ppl out there). To do this, type:
   tar zxvf psyBNC2.3.1.tar.gz

   Notice that it's case-sensitive. Everything in unix is case-sensitive.
   Keep that in mind for everything in the future.

   If you typed the correctly, you should have a psybnc directory on your
   shell. Change to it and see what you have!
   cd psybnc
   ls -al

----------
----------
He did that too, same version and all!
----------
----------


   Now, this next part is where it gets a bit harder. psyBNC includes a
   GUI for configuring the bnc. However, this requires ncurses to be
   installed on your shell, something a bunch of shells do not have. In
   my experience, most flavors of linux have it installed, but some
   others don't. So, give it a whirl. Type:
   make menuconfig

----------
----------
We have ncurses but make menuconfig was the next thing he did.
----------
----------



   If you get a GUI, congrats: the configuring process is much easier. If
   not, well, welcome to my world ;) With menuconfig, the GUI is very
   easy to follow: obviously an [X] denotes that the option is selected,
   while [ ] indicates it's not.

   For all those stuck doing it by hand, after each option I explain how
   to set it. For all the compiling options, everything is placed in the
   file config.h, which is found in the psybnc directory. Just open that
   file with your favorite editor on the shell (I use and recommend pico
   - You can edit the file by typing:
   pico config.h

----------
----------
I think this never happened - so he did a standard psyBNC config.
Or maybe he gave up - it was all too hard.
----------
----------



   Compiling options
   Support Encryption #define CRYPT


   This encrypts all your passwords, and enables support for channel
   encryption, relay encryption, etc... I highly recommend you leave this
   enabled.
   Encryption Type #define BLOWFISH or #define IDEA


   (default = Blowfish) Cryptographically speaking, these ciphers are
   about equally secure. However, Blowfish is much faster. You can read
   more about Blowfish here Also, IDEA is patent-protected - you should
   get permission before using it!
   Support Translation #define TRANSLATE


   This lets you type in english (or whatever your language is) and have
   the text in the channel appear in a different language. You'll have to
   see the README for more information: I don't use this feature.
   Support Internal Network #define INTNET


   This lets you use the internal ircd that psy has. Think of it as a big
   partyline where you can set modes/bans/topic/etc... I like it, and I
   recommend you leave it enabled.
   Support Traffic Logging #define TRAFFICLOG


   This enables support for logging channels when you're not around. It
   can be handy, but it can also eat up your shell disk space VERY fast.
   So be careful if you enable this. (note: you can leave support for it
   enabled here, then disable it after it is compiled by simply turning
   it off)
   Support Linkage #define LINKAGE


   If you want your bnc to link to others (or others to link to yours),
   enable this. I use it.
   Support DCC Files / DCC Chat #define DCCFILES and #define DCCCHAT


   Standard DCC features over IRC. Most people use these features, so
   leave em be.
   User Mode #define MULTIUSER or #define SINGLEUSER


   Multiuser or Singleuser. If you're going to share your bnc, set it to
   multi. If it's just you, set it to Single.
   Maxium users #define MAXUSER n


   Pretty self-explanatory. However note that each network you add (if
   you use multiple networks) adds a virtual user. Be sure to keep this
   in mind when setting a max! (And really a max is pointless unless you
   are running an anonymous bnc) (n = # of users)
   Maximum connections #define MAXCONN n


   This is the number that each user can have. They need at least 2
   (incoming/outgoing) and more for dcc's, multiple networks, etc. I
   suggest leaving it at 25. (n = # of connections per user)
   Support Scripting #define SCRIPTING


   psyBNC allows user-specific scripts. I will not discuss that in this
   tutorial, but it doesn't hurt to leave support for it enabled.
   Support oIdentd #define OIDENTD


   If your shell supports it, this allows users to define their own
   ident. Most don't support it. I don't use it. (for more info on
   oIdentd: http://ojnk.sourceforge.net/)
   Use asynchroneous resolving #define ???? definition unknown


   EXPERIMENTAL!!Tells psy to use asynchronous (as opposed to
   synchronous) DNS lookups. This is not a tutorial on DNS so I will not
   get into it. Note this works only if your system supports it!
   Support Multiple IRC Networks #define NETWORK


   This allows users to connect to >1 network with the same client.
   Hence, in one mirc session, the user could be on efnet, dalnet and
   ircnet. I love this feature and recommend you leave it enabled (even
   if you don't plan to use it now).
   Support proxy usage #define PROXYS


   If you want to further anonymize your connection by bouncing
   mirc-->bnc-->proxy-->irc, enable this. But since most irc servers
   check for open proxies, this won't work in many cases.
   Anonymous Bouncer Usage #define ANONYMOUS


   Want the whole world to use your bnc? Then enable this! (not
   recommended)
   No Permanent IRC-Connections #define DYNAMIC


   If this is enabled, psy will disconnect you from irc when you
   disconnect rom the bnc. Otheriwse, you'll always stay connected to irc
   unless you force it to quit.
   Loglevel #define LOGLEVEL n


   3 different options here, choose your poison. I prefer to leave them
   all enabled since I like to know everything going on with my bnc.
   (define where n is: 0 = Errors, Warnings and Info; 1 = Errors and
   Warnings; 2 = Errors only)
   Use the 2.1.1 compatible partyline #define PARTYCHANNEL


   If you're going to be linking to old psy's, this might be good to
   enable. But if you're the only bnc, or if they're all > 2.2, no need
   to enable this option.
   Version reply #define CTCPVERSION "reply"


   Set the reply psybnc will send when someone sends you a CTCP VERSION
   query. (note: when you are connected to the bnc, psy will be
   transparent, all ctcp's will be answered by mirc. When you're not
   connected, psy will only answer to the version ctcp as set by this
   option.) (psy defaults to: "psyBNC 2.3.1 by the most psychoid")
   SSL-Path #define SSLPATH "/path/to/ssl"


   (default: wherever your openssl installation has been detected) - If
   you wish the use SSL on your bnc, the default here should be fine.
   However, if you have multiple openssl installations for some reason,
   then define the path to the one you want to use. If you do not want
   SSL compiled into psyBNC, then specify something like /dev/null here.
   Note that you can compile SSL support into your bnc and simply not use
   it.
   SSL-SecLevel #define SSLSEC n


   (default: Check Certs and Keys (NOT IMPLEMENTED)) - Sets the security
   level of your SSL setup. This can be one of the following: None, Check
   Certs, or the default. These different options correspond to values 0,
   1 and 2 respectively for use in config.h. As with async DNS, this is
   not an SSL tutorial. Note however that setting 'None' does NOT disable
   SSL; it simply does not check client certificates. If you're using SSL
   for encryption only, then you can safely set this option to None.
   Furthermore, psyBNC has not yet implemented client-checking functions.


   Once you have all these options set, you have two choices: If you're
   using menuconfig, skip to the next step. If you're doing it manually,
   this is where you actually want to compile your bnc. It's very easy to
   do. In the psybnc directory, simply type:
   make

   It won't take long to compile. If you have compiled with SSL enabled,
   you'll have to create a self-signed certificate at the end of the
   compilation process. Simply follow the prompts that you are given. The
   most common error is to specify a wrong Common Name. According to
   certificate standards, the common name must be a FQHN: Fully Qualified
   HostName, i.e: psybnc.mydomain.com. Since the certifcate is simply
   being used a an encryption seed and not as a validation of identity,
   this is not really important - the cert is not being signed a real CA
   anyway!

   Configuring options

   If you're using the GUI, all these options are accessable under the
   Bouncer-Config part of the menu. If you're not using the GUI, all
   these options are in psybnc.conf, which is created in the psybnc
   directory after it is compiled. To edit these options manually, just
   edit this file. The Appendix has the proper syntax for each option.
   The rest of this section will cover the GUI method.

   Before going through these options, do the following: know the IP of
   your shell. for example, if you connect to l33t.shell.com open up a
   console (or command prompt in Win) and ping the hostname. You should
   see something like this:
   -bash-2.05b$ ping www.efnet.org
   PING www.efnet.org (193.45.36.242): 56 data bytes
   64 bytes from 193.45.36.242: icmp_seq=0 ttl=49 time=132.975 ms

   So if your shell was www.efnet.org (which I can guarantee it is not!),
   the corresponding IP would be 193.45.36.242.

   Also, choose a port for the bnc. Check the Terms of Use of your shell
   - some companies require you to use a certain port range. And if
   you're on a *nix shell, the port will have to be higher than 1024
   (unless you run the bnc as root, which is certainly not recommended!).
   Ok, on to the options, same basic format as the compiling options.
   Listening ports


   You have to tell the bnc where to listen. You can have it listen on
   more than one port on the same IP, on multiple IPs with the same port,
   etc. For most people, listening on just one port on one IP is
   adequate. (the psy default is 31337, and you can leave it at that with
   no problems, but it is always a good security practice to change the
   port). If you wish to create an SSL listening port, precede the
   HOSTentry with "S=" i.e.: PSYBNC.SYSTEM.HOST1=S=123.123.123.123
   This will make the specified port(s) on 123.123.123.123 an SSL port.
   PSYBNC.SYSTEM.PORT1=xxxxx should never have an "S=" in it.
   Links


   Don't worry about this now.
   Bouncer Name


   Name your bnc. Something like mypsy1 will work just fine.
   Host Allows


   Want to restrict access to certain IPs or certian IP masks? This is
   the place to put those permissions. psy will disallow access to anyone
   not listed here. To allow anyone (provided they have the correct
   username and password) set this to *.
   Users


   At this point, you want to just add yourself. Adding other users will
   be discussed in more detail later. In menuconfig, just select this,
   select New then follow the directions. Remember that to connect to
   psybnc, your ident in mirc must be set to your psybnc username. For
   all those manual people, jump down to the Appendix, which is where you
   should be anyway.
   DCC Host


   The IP to use for all your DCC sessions (if you defined DCC support).
   I recommend setting it to the same IP that your bnc is listening on
   for simplicity.


   Congrats, your setup is complete. If you haven't done so already, it's
   time to compile your bnc by typing "make" at the shell prompt in your
   psybnc directory. Then type "./psybnc" to start the bouncer. Hopefully
   everything went smoothly and you're ready to jump into the next
   section.



   Setting up your Account

   The first thing you need to do is connect to your bnc. In your irc
   client, open up the connect dialogue box and add in another server.
   Name it My BNC or something like that, enter the IP and port, and
   enter the password that you chose (either through menuconfig or in the
   conf file). Now make sure that your ident is set to your username.
   It's also a good idea to set your e-mail address to
   username@whatever.com. If psy can't get an ident response from you, it
   checks your e-mail addy as verification of the username. If everything
   goes well, you'll see this when you connect:
   -Welcome- psyBNC2.3.1

   Now you need to get connected to irc: first, you need to select your
   vhost. To see what vhosts are available, at your shell prompt type:
   vhosts

   This command is only available if your shell provider has created such
   a function, but in my experience 99% have. For security reasons (?),
   there is no way to view the vhosts in psy. After your vhost is
   selected, you'll need to add in some irc servers, and set a few other
   options. the commands follow below. All commands appear like this
   /mycommand, everything else after it is an explanation. All brackets
   are for my purposes, don't use brackets in any command!
   /bvhost [vhost] -- (this command used to be /vhost) -- [vhost] is your
   vhost in alpha form (ie, this.is.a.cool.vhost.com and not 127.0.0.1)
   /addserver [server] :[port] -- server can be in alpha or numeric
   form...

   Once you add in the server, psy will auto-connect to it in a short
   while. You can add in more servers so that if one goes down, psy can
   reconnect to a different one. Just use the command above again. For
   server managment:
   /listservers -- lists all the servers you have added
   /delserver [n] -- deletes the server with #[n] (as shown by the
   listservers command)
   /jump -- disconnects you from your current server and attempts to
   connect to the next server in your list
   /bquit -- disconnects you from the server until you force it to
   connect
   /bconnect -- connects you to irc

   Now, remember that psy will keep you connected to irc even when you're
   not connected to the bnc. So, these commands are helpful:
   /setaway [message] -- psy will display this message to all channels
   you're on when you quit the bnc. It will NOT repeat this message
   (since that's gay). To remove the message, just type /setaway
   /setawaynick [nick] -- when you quit the bnc, psy will auto-change
   your nick to the nick you set here. When you reconnect, it'll auto
   change it back to what's shown in the mirc nick.

     OK, now for some more commands that ppl find useful. Remember that
   ALL commands are in the README file that came with psybnc. I'm not
   going to repeat all of them.
   /playprivatelog -- plays the log of all messages sent to you when you
   were disconnected from the bnc. The log will be opened in a window
   called -psyBNC.
   /eraseprivatelog -- erases the aforementioned log.

   psy has a damn cool feature in that it allows encryption. You can
   encrypt text sent to a channel or a person. Each person needs to have
   the same key to view the text. This is helpful if you're paranoid, or
   if you want to have a private conversation in a public channel. (Why
   you wouldn't just pm is beyond me ;) It also makes you look l33t lol.
   /encrypt [password] :[channel/person] -- make sure everyone you want
   to speak with has the same key. And they need to be using psybnc as
   well. duh.
   /listencrypt -- lists your current encryptions
   /delencrypt [n] -- deletes encryption #[n] as shown by the
   listencryption command.



   User Management

   Obviously, if you have your bnc compiled as singleuser, this section
   is pointless for you. But for everyone else, I'm sure you want to add
   in other users, delete them, etc... Here's the commands to do it:
   /adduser [user] :[real name] -- the [user] is what the person will
   have to set their ident to. The [real name] part is what ppl will see
   when doing a /whois. for example:
   /adduser jestrix :me love you long time
   will show this in the first line of a whois:
   jestrix is ident@vhost * me love you long time.
   /deluser [user] -- deletes the user.
   /password [new pass] -- changes your password. If you're an admin, you
   can change other ppl's passwords:/password [user] :[pass]
   /madmin [user] -- makes a user into an admin (choose your admins
   carefully!)
   /unadmin [user] -- removes admin rights from a user.
   /bwho --- see who is added to your bouncer. Also shows if they're
   connected, what server they're connected to, and what their IP is.

   I recommend you secure your bnc even more by restricting what IPs can
   connect to it:
   /addallow [IP or mask] --- lets whatever IP or mask you specify
   connect to the bnc. IPs can be definite, ie. 12.12.12.34 or masked,
   12.12.12.*. You can also use hostnames and masks such as *.myisp.com.
   /listallow --- lists the allowed connections.
   /delallow [n] --- deletes allow #n as shown by listallow.



   DCC Stuff

   This section assumes that you compiled your bnc with DCCFILE and
   DCCCHAT. If you did not, then you can do all your dcc stuff as you
   normally would in your irc client, but remember that your real IP will
   be revealed by doing this. Like I stated before, the benefit of psyBNC
   is that it hides your IP during DCC sessions, but in order to do this,
   your life gets a bit harder. First, let's go over the basic DCC
   commands:
   /dccchat [user] --- opens a dcc chat session with the user you
   specify.
   /dccsend [file] :[user] --- sends a file to the person you specify.
   The file MUST be in ~/psybnc/downloads/USERx (where USERx is your user
   #. Not sure what your user # is? do a /bwho
   /dccanswer [user] --- if someone sends you a dcc chat request, psy
   will inform you through a notice. You must then type this to accept
   the request.
   /dccget [file] :[user] --- gets a file that was dcc'd to you by
   someone. This file will be stored in the ~/psybnc/downloads/USERx
   directory.
   /dccsendme [file] --- tells psy to send you the file you specify. Use
   this after you get a file from another user and then want to get it
   from your shell. This is the only way people without shell access can
   get their files.
   /listdcc --- lists all dcc's
   /dcccancel [n] --- cancels dcc # n as shown by /listdcc

   If you wish to use SSL encrypted DCC sessions, precede the value of
   the command with "S=" ie: /dccchat S=l33th4x0r - Note that the other
   person must have an SSL capable client.

   Now for the cool stuff :) my favorite feature of psy is its ability to
   stay permanently connected to a bot through a DCC, and to ask this bot
   for ops. As anyone who has experience with running a botnet knows, one
   of the easiest ways for a channel to be taken over is to have some
   idiot /msg [bot] OP [password], when the bot's nick was taken by
   someone else. With psy, however, the askop request can be done two
   ways: through the partyline when a DCC is initiated, or through a msg
   that first checks the mask of the person being sent the request.
   Sweet, eh? So, the commands to do it:
   /adddcc [botname] [username] [password] :[host]:[port] --- The botname
   is obviously the name of the bot, The username and password are your
   personal l/p that you use to gain access to the bot's partyline. The
   host is the host of the bot. It can be either the alpha-form, or the
   actual IP address. I prefer the actual IP address, since it's possible
   DNS can be down. And finally, the port is the port that the bot
   listens on for user connections. Some bots listen for other bots on
   one port and for users on another, so make sure you get the right one
   :)
   /listdcc --- lists all dcc's
   /deldcc [n] --- deletes dcc # n as shown by /listdcc

   Now, for the askops part: This part assumes you added in a DCC to the
   bot as shown above. If you don't have partyline access, you can still
   add an askop, but I'll get to that later.
   /addask [#chan] [password] :-[botname] --- The chan is the channel you
   want to get ops on, the password is your password, and the bot's nick,
   preceded with a :-, is the bot which you have a dcc enabled to.
   /listask --- lists all the askops you have
   /delask [n] --- deletes askop # n as shown by /listask

   Now, if you don't have partyline access, you can add the askop in this
   way:
   /addask [#chan] [password] :[bothost] --- where chan is the channel
   you want to be opped on, your password is your password (duh), and the
   bothost is the bot's hostmask. A hostmask, for the uninformed, is
   formed like this: username!ident@host. Since a bot is set to use a
   different nick if someone takes their default, set the host for
   something like: *!mybot@damn.cool.vhost.com.



   Multiple Networks

   One of my other favorite things about psyBNC :) Do you have a bunch of
   channels you hang in on efnet, but also one or two channels on dalnet
   that you like to go to? If you're like me, you do...but you alo hate
   having multiple mirc sessions open. Fret no more! psyBNC can solve
   your problems by allowing you to connect to more than one network with
   the same mirc client. For this section I'll assume that you're
   familiar with most of the commands in psy. If not, get familiar with
   them before you try to do this. Ok, let's get into the commands.

   The first thing you need to do is add in another network:
   /addnetwork [name] --- adds in a network with the name you specify.
   Keep in mind that network names are case-sensitive. Furthermore,
   you'll be typing the name a lot, so if you're adding in dalnet, use
   the name dal or dn or something similar.

   Once you have the network added, you need to choose your vhost for
   that network. If you don't choose one, it'll default to the IP the bnc
   is on, usually something gay like "my-shell-company.com". So:
   /bvhost [network]~[vhost] --- sets your vhost on the network you
   specify.

   See this command? This is the format for all commands used on multiple
   networks. Simply prefix the syntax of the command with [network]. So,
   to give some other examples:
   /addserver dn~irc.dal.net:6667 --- adds in the server irc.dal.net with
   port 6667 to the dn network.
   /join dn~#fxp --- joins #fxp on network dn. (btw, I hear that some
   freaky ppl hang in this particular channel ;)
   /msg dn~joeschmoe beeyatch --- sends the message "beeyatch" to the
   user with the nick joeschmoe on network dn.

   Now, some weird things about multiple networks:
    Your nick in the nicklists for channels on other networks will show
   the nick you're using on your primary network. So, even if you do:
   /nick dn~TwatMuffin, even though other ppl will now see you as
   TwatMuffin in their list, you'll see yourself as jestrix, or whatever
   nick you use.
    If you get opped/voiced in a channel, you won't see it in the
   nicklist. You'll just appear to be a regular schmoe.
    Let's say JoeSmith is in #chat on efnet, your primary network. You
   head over to dalnet, and he's there in #fxp. Everyone else in #fxp
   will look like dn~BobJones, but JoeSmith will be just JoeSmith. If you
   try to msg him by dbl-clicking on his nick int he dalnet channel,
   you'll really be sending a msg to him on efnet. You have to use
   dn~JoeSmith to talk with him on dalnet.

   Some final things. Maybe you don't always want to be on more than one
   network. I prefer to always be on efnet, and then head to my other
   networks when I want to talk with ppl there.
   /bconnect [network]~ --- connects you to the network you specify
   (assuming you have servers added for that network)
   /bquit [network]~ --- quits you from that network. You'll still be
   connected to your primary network. Note, if you do /bquit, you'll be
   quitted from all your networks.
   /switchnet [new network] :[current network] --- This command will let
   you switch your primary network. By doing this, you won't have to
   prefix all your commands with the ~net syntax.
   For example, let's say that you are on EFNet and DalNet. Efnet is your
   primary network (you dont need to prefix anything with the ~ format)
   and DalNet is added as ~dn. If you currently did /msg jestrix, you
   would be messaging jestrix on efnet.
   If you do /switchnet dn :ef your current network will be assigned to
   dn - DalNet. Now if you /msg jestrix you will get jestrix on DalNet.
   To msg him on EFNet, you would have to do /msg ef~jestrix - since ef
   was the prefix you assigned in the switchnet command. To switch back
   to your original config, you'd do: /switchnet ef :dn

   OK, multiple networks also includes the psy internal network. Think of
   it as an ircd inside your bnc. By using the network name int you can
   create private channels that only ppl connected to your bnc can
   access.
   For example, /join int~#partyline will have you join the internal
   channel #partyline. You can set modes/ops/topic in the internal
   channels just like you would on a normal channel. do a whois on
   someone in an internal channel, it looks neat ;)
   You can also privately msg other people connected to your bnc: /msg
   $[nick]. Prefix it with a $ and psy will send it directly to the
   person on the bnc; it will not pass through the irc server. (So if you
   both are on SSL-enabled clients/bncs - the message is perfectly secure
   in transit!)



   Linking

   A cool aspect of psy is the ability form a psy-net through the linkage
   of multiple psybncs. The benefit of this is to create a private
   internal network secure from snooping, and secure from takeovers!
   Furthermore, you can let ppl on other bouncers use your machine's
   vhosts if you wish. As you should have realized by now, preceding an
   IP with S= creates an SSL port.

   So, to create a link to another bouncer:
   /linkto [name of other bnc] :[IP]:[port]

   The other bouncer would have to do the following:
   /linkfrom [name of other bnc] :[IP]:[port]

   To view all your links:
   /listlinks

   I love to have everything encrypted, including my links. To create an
   encrypted link:
   /setlinkkey [link #] :[password]
   After doing this on both psy's, do:
   /relink [link #] on either bouncer to reset

   To enable the sharing of vhosts:
   /relaylink [name of other bnc] :n --- where n=0 to disable vhost
   sharing; 1 to enable it.

   Final note: If you use hostmasks to restrict connections to your bnc,
   you must add the other bnc's IP as an allowed host!!



   Appendix

   For one reason or another, you might want to edit your psybnc.conf
   (especially if menuconfig doesn't work for you). So, here are the
   applicable lines and what they mean. I'm sure I've missed a few lines,
   so if you find anything and know what it does, please email me at
   jestrix(at)jestrix(dot)net. Note that all the variables in psybnc.conf
   are CAPITALIZED and that there are no spaces on either side of the
   equal sign.
   Variables are shown in this style.

   for multiple hosts. If you want an SSL port, Put an 'S=' before the
   IP.
   PSYBNC.SYSTEM.DCCHOST= The IP that will be used for DCC sessions.
   PSYBNC.HOSTALLOWS.ENTRY0= The first IP that will be allowed to connect

   form of hostmask;password. (not covered in this tutorial)


   ###LINKAGE STUFF###
   LINKS.LINK1.PORT= Port for link 1
   LINKS.LINK1.NAME= name of the otehr bnc
   LINKS.LINK1.IAM= name of the other bnc (redundant?)
   LINKS.LINK1.HOST= IP of the link
   LINKS.LINK1.PASS= Password for the link (used only by the bncs)
   LINKS.LINK1.ALLOWRELAY= 0-Do not share vhosts; 1-Allow the sharing of

   links to yours.


   ###DCC AND ASKOP STUFF###
   (note: I don't recommend editing any of these variables through
   psybnc.onf -> use the commands in mirc.
   USER1.DCC.ENTRY0= Stuff pertaining to DCC #0
   USER1.ASK.ENTRY0= Stuff pertaining to AskOp #0



   Setting Crontab

   The basic form for a crontab entry is (to the best of my knowledge):
   <minute> <hour> <day> <week> <month> <process to run>

   So, if you like to check every 10min, it would be:
   0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /path/to/my/process

   Included with psybnc is psybncchk. Open this file and change the line
   that reads PSYBNCPATH=/set/path/here. Set it to your psybnc directory
   of course. Make sure this file has execute perms; in your shell, type:
   chmod 700 psybncchk

   Then add the following to your crontab (use crontab -e to edit your
   crontab): (this example is for a check every 10 minutes:
   0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /l33t/shell/psybnc/psybncchk >/dev/null 2>&1

   The >/dev/null 2>&1 part tells crontab not to send you an e-mail
   whenever it restarts psybnc. Omit that part if you like e-mail.

Our crontab is unaltered since 2002.

   SSL Enabled Clients

   If you have compiled psyBNC with SSL and created an SSL listening
   port, you must use an SSL capable client to connect. It is possible to
   use any client with SSL if you create a tcp wrapper (using something
   such as stunnel), but I will not get into that. So if you're using
   mIRC or another non-SSL client, search google for tutorials on how to
   create an SSL wrapper.

   At the moment, I am only aware of 1 client with built in SSL support
   (tho I may be prejudiced since it is the only client i use other than
   BX): XChat. I highly recommend this client - both for real operating
   systems like linux or BSD, and even for windows. One thing to note:
   when connecting to your bnc w/ SSL, tell XChat to accept invalid
   certs! Going by SSL-standards, an application that encounters a
   self-signed certificate (which I guarantee you have) should either
   prompt the user for confirmation or kill the connection. XChat chooses
   the latter (something i disagree with) but by telling it to accept
   invalid certs, it will work fine.

   If you use an SSL compatible client that you'd like listed here, send
   me the info and a link at jestrix(at)jestrix(dot)net
