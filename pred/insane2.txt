Cont: the continuing saga of the SANE install.

I have acquired a cable which is a DB25 male on one end and DB25
Female on the other. It's one of those ones which is injection
moulded so you dont actually know if it's wired pin to pin or some
other way, like RS232 or something. Open hardware has screws...

The other thing I have acquired from the SANE pages is the tarball of
a module specific for the parallel port scanner I have, which is an
OpticPro 4800P, which is made by plustek. This scanner is known by
many names, it is sold with different badges on it. It is supported
by SANE. The relevant module (I dont think it's a kernel loadable
one) is contained in the tarball called plustek-module-0_39_3.tar.gz

Apparently it needs to be untarred not in the backend but in the
actual sane directory, wherever that is... probably /usr/include/sane
since the tarball will be full of headders and c source to be
compiled. Or maybe it goes in the /root/xsane-0.78 directory? Or
maybe the directory where the exe is, /usr/bin/xsane? Hmmm. I guess
that /root/xsane-0.78/lib has blah.c files that the .c files should
go here and since , /root/xsane-0.78/include has blah.h files that
the tarball .h files shoudl maybe go here.

So, in /root/xsane-0.78
# tar -zxvf plustek-module-0_39_3.tar.gz

Stuff uncompresses and then there's some whinges concerning gzip
meeting an unexpected EOF, then tar hinges about an unexpected end of
file in the archive too. I have a new directory, called
plustek_driver which has under it two directories called h and src,
each contains headders and c source, respectively. No docs. Ok, well
now what?

I think we're up for anothe config and compile. Try this...

# CFLAGS="-g -O -Wall" ./configure

******************************************
ERROR: SANE-1.0.0 or newer is needed for compiling xsane
 - if you installed SANE as rpm make sure you also included sane-devel
******************************************

yeah? Well, ya compiled before... and I *do* have those, because...

# rpm -q sane 
sane-1.0.1-4
# rpm -q sane-devel
sane-devel-1.0.1-4

What gives...? Further back in the config report listing is this:


sed: can't read  ./intl/po2tbl.sed.in: No such file or directory
checking for sane-config... no
checking for SANE - version >=1.0.0... no

*** The sane-config script installed by SANE could not be found
*** If SANE was installed in PREFIX, make sure PREFIX/bin is in
*** your path, or set the SANE_CONFIG environment variable to the
*** full path to sane-config.

Great. I know i have po2tbl.sed.in
# slocate -u
# locate po2tbl

/usr/share/gettext/intl/po2tbl.sed.in
/root/xsane-0.78/intl/po2tbl.sed

but 

#locate sane-config

gets me nothing and

#env | grep SANE

gets me nothing too.

I think what this is telling me is that when I rpm'd the file it
needed to be rpm'd someplace else. If I can't just rpm -i it from
wherever the hell I happen to be, the logic eludes me.

At this point the tossing of clues in my general direction is encouraged.
