field0 = predator
field1 = I'm not doing the GCSE and do not know where to ask: I have a
question
 involving permutations and combinations and I am not sure how to phrase
 it mathematically. It goes like so:
 I have x carbon atoms (which can link to 0-4 other atoms)
 I have y oxygen atoms (which can link to 0-2 other atoms)
 I have z hydrogen atoms (which can link to 0-1 other atoms).
 Any atom can link to any other atom up to the limit of its ability to link.
 When any two atoms link, this creates a BOND.
 When x=2 and y=1 and z=6 the maximum number of bonds = 8, which encodes a
maximum of two molecules.
 Number of bonds ranges from 0 to 8.
 Exceptions: carbon cannot link to another carbon 4 times.
             carbon cannot link to another carbon 3 times AND at the same
time have an oxygen linked to both carbons to form a ring
             carbon cannot link to another carbon 2 times AND at the same
time have an oxygen linked to both carbons to form a ring
 So my question is: how to calculate all the possible states of linkage?
             Sorry if this melts your head. It melts mine. If you can think
of anyone else who could answer this, please feel free to pass it on.

We can use a generating function and find the sum of the coefficients.  This
would give the total number of different arrangements with total bonds
ranging from 0 to 8.  We must then subtract the   3 arrangements listed
above which are not permitted.

The generating function is

    (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4)^2.(1 + x + x^2).(1 + x)^6

Since we want the sum of all the coefficients this can be done by putting
x=1 in the generating function and working out its value.

  Sum of coefficients = 5^2 x 3 x 2^6  =  25 x 3 x 64

                                       = 4800

We subtract the 3 exceptions to get   4797 possible combinations.
