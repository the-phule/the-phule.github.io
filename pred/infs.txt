(Lab 7 was empty for an hour! It's like an icebox in there, too. Anyway!)

The above people asked for and were given the standard crash-course in
how to drive composer, and know what composer (c.f. navigator) does, and
to a lesser extent what the various tags mean. I tend to get them to
actually build parts of the demonstration page themselves, now, since the
small groups lend themselves to this and they seem to pay more attention
when they know they'll have to drive the mouse and select some text and
tag it up some way (make it a link, italicise it, etc).

People are still not clear about the requirements for the site map and the
storyboard (nor am I, so I can't really tell them). Some of these students
actually had started accounts at places like yahoo, or geocities, and had
become acquainted with some of the ftp-like functionality of the web-based
file transfer infrastructure on these sites (browse, click on this file,
and it is sent to the site) but none had directly played with a straight
ftp client like ws_ftp.

Back again on monday 19th!

Cheeries!
