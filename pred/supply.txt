Um... is there a reason you crosspost this to slug? I'm not worried but
they might be ... anyway, hope we can help.

Does this mean the original or replacement motherboard crashes regularly,
or both?

Ok. Please describe crashes...? Kernel oops? Knop-Version specific?
App-specific? Peripheral card activity specific?

How's your RAM? memtest86 it from knoppix root shell.

You're looking for some common dodgy bit of hardware which means this
problem is following you around.

How many peripheral cards / devices has your machine? All slots/bays full?

Most power supplies have a positive-temperature co-efficient resistor in
there someplace to drive logic for thermal shutdown. But not all. It might
be a bit risky to use this PSU anyway... I dunno yet.

Is this the the stench of hot dust or the stench of charring printed
circuit board (circuit boards smell more like burning plastic, smouldering
dust smells more like burning hair due to the protein content in the dust
which is mostly skin flakes)

ATX PSU I guess? Hmmm... how old is it? Does the fan still turn? How much
didja pay for it?

Pay real bux for and inspect your PSU... it matters. Ask 'em in the
shop to open the PSU before you buy it. A QC sticker means jack shit to
you, since they make them by the million in China and stick'em on
everything from power supplies to underpants.

Look at the small 85 watt ones internally vs a 300 watt one for component
size and rating comparison. You want a PSU running well within its
capacity, not struggling at its limits.

Look for BIG FAT 3-terminal regulators (not axial diodes in their place,
they don't cool as well as equivalent-function regs due to poor contact
patch between cylindrical body and flat heatsink, and relatively small
x-section of conductor rails which are used as heatsinks in cost-cutting
case.),

You want electrolytic capacitors rated to 105 deg C, vaned Aluminium
heatsinks (not flat galsteel, Al has less thermal mass and better
conductivity); pref, anodised black. Lots of case vent holes.

You also want a thermal cutout which does (there'll be something on the
PSU circuit board which says ptc1 near the component). Protective grommets
on the feed rails was they pass thru the case on the way out to the mobo.
A ball bearing fan! Big toroids. PCB *screwed* to chassis, not
plastic-clipped, not stuck on with silicone/glue. Earth rail bolted to
chassis. MOVs on the incoming mains rails for spike suppression. LC Noise
filter on IEC-III mains intake.

Most will fail on these some or all of these criteria. Why you care is you
might have a mobo worth 10x the price of the PSU connected to the PSU.


I see *stupid* design shit in PSUs, I tossed an Osborne one wherein the
heatsink was screwed to the chassis cowl and blocking the fan vent ports;
ones where wires gradually move around over time and catch the fan blades,
or dust traps around components tightly packed which then get cooked
anyway; small electrolytic capacitors (eg, by CHSSI) spill their guts due
to wrong electrolyte chemistry, regs cooking out due to inadequate thermal
coupling to heatsinks (no heatsink grease), rah rah rah. They make them
out of minimum qual materials and get away with it 'cos only weirdos like
me crack 'em open and make a judgement. 

The failure of a $3 fan in a stock $40 ATX PSU nearly ended my dad's
business - gradually cooked the backup harddisk (40Gb maxtor in the top
drive bay) which brought to our attention that the fan had siezed, when
the harddisk felt scaldingly hot when I went to inspect it. If we hadn't
cracked it open we'd have never known the PSU was basically a room heater,
until it would have eventually caught alight and fried the machine with
it. New PSU (opened and checked out first for qual, then modded), ball
bearing fan installed, plus two other fans in the main chassis. They
*depend* on this box to run the biz.

Modern (n > 1GHz)  mobos suck more juice than the older ones so demand
more grunt from PSU. 300watts should be heaps, conway's 800MHz Pent-III
with four hdd's eats 90 watts, less with drives spun down.

Your PSU has had how many hours up? If not 5 months _continuous_, then you
might have a defective infant mortal getting dead at this stage. Crack it
open... look for charred components. Return under warrantee... if you
think they'll bullshit to you that warrantee is void cos you took the PSU
case off, get them to open it in front of you. 

I find some charred ATX PSUs will still work while fan is siezed and PSU
is nearly about to catch fire, in this mode they cook the computer from
the top down... you get CPU glitches due to CPU being too hot (check in
BIOS or use hand on heatsink - careful, can be *very* hot) which is why
the next conway chassis will have redundant fans.

As PSU gets really hot and out of expected operating temp range, the
semiconductors which do its logic and power regulation experience
tolerance drift, which might mean funny voltages are getting fed to the
mobo beyond its tolerance to regulate them. Glitch time!

Also: For servers, or any machines which matter, open PSU anyway, remove
shit-qual elcheapoid sleeve-bearing fan, insert 12V ball-bearing fan and
feed from same rails as original fan, or remove shit-qual fan and insert
240V ball bearing fan, same size - these things really move some air.
Solder 240V fan feeds onto IEC-III incoming socket. Ballbearing fan lasts
usually at least 25k hours depending on environmental dust. Cut half the
bullshit do-not-insert-finger vanes off the exhaust port for better flow
(not all, you need your fingers to not go thru the fan and touch the
circuitry).
