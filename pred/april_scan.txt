April 20. I stuffed my bod in the CT scanner at Hurstville. Three times
they stuck my unaesthetised veins with a 19-gague needle but couldn't get
any blood so eventually they stuck me with a smaller 21-gague needle and
that worked ok. I'd be faintly pissed off about this 'cos I have veins
like garden hoses and any dork should be able to cannulate them, but I
have other things to angst about at the mo. I'm a bit of a pincushion,
covered in bandaids. Whammo, in went that iopamidol, I've grown to love
its whooshy hot rush. The unfortunately named Dr Lazarus wrote this about
the scanned cervicothoracic images.

"There is an ill defined mass in the left supraclavicular fossa which
 measures approx 5 x 3cm in diameter. It extends superiorly for a distance
 of 10cm. The mass is enhancing heterogeneously and it contains several
 low density areas consistent with necrosis. 

 The mass is situated deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and
 superficial to the thyroid gland. It begins at the level of the superior
 pole of the thyroid on the left and extends inferiorly to the thoracic
 inlet and is compressing the left brachiocephalic vein. The left common
 carotid artery appears normal but the left jugular vein was not visualised
 and is either compressed or invaded. No other masses are detected within
 the neck.

 On mediastinal windows there is no definite hilar or mediastinal
 adenopathy. The pleura are normal. On lung windows there are no
 metastases. The left nephrectomy is noted. The cholecystectomy is
 noted. There are no obvious liver metastases."
