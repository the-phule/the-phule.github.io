Pardon data staleness... have had to think about this a bit, plus
gradually ratchet it up on the priority queue. Has been in my postponed
bin for ages.

No. It's quite remarkable. Ever lived in a collective?

Yes, the basement was sunless, damp and moldy. Welcome respite from heat
in summer, and very quiet, too. Mold (mostly) and damp went away when I
installed a computer fan to suck air outside dry air in. Oh, and hit the
cieling with marine grade copper naphthenate.  

Once one goes up two flights of stairs one comes to the very nice kitchen
which has none of these except rats, in the ceiling. I'm taking over my
old room, top floor, lots of sunlight, carpet, power, clean mattress off
floor, lighting, no leaks, lockable door. sometime next week. Will need
to augment with some soundproofing, but don't anticipate any difficulties.
Need to replace one stair step. Might spraypaint the walls camouflagey.

Mmmm. I do, as a rule, tend to avoid being there for anything other than
sleep, for which it does me well.

The bulk of my income is not cash.

Yep. Most of my tools have a better location than I do : back shed at the
olds' place. Which, was, initially, just another place to dump their vast
and ancient accumulation of unused junk. Over a period of about a year I
have managed to burn/bury/remove most of it, and shed's now equipped with
most of the stuff I tend to use... augmented considerably I might add by
the excellent things I've scavenged from roadside. Like, the workbench,
the power points, lights, saws, files, etc etc etc. Oh and mains
electrickery (v.handy). Been useful in process of repair of dry rot in
their roof, which has required salvage and conversion of excellent red
cedar fence posts from 50 y.o. back fence (recently replaced) to roof
rafters, cut and fit of battens/joists, replacement of Pb sheet and
sarking and exposed earth wires (eek)... plus all the other things I do
around there, like grow profitable functional analogues to certain
psychotropics with which you have some familiarity... and which aren't
illegal, and which are weight-for-weight more powerful than the 25-analog
of a certain ergonovine molecules. 

None of these tools are really mol-bio tools, but a significant quant of
them are borosilicate chem tools, and feelers are out for mol-bio tools.
Centrifuges, autoclave, fridge/freezers, pippettors. Some acquired
already.

Many mol-bio tools are straightforwardly constructed. Electrophoresis
rigs, UV tools, dessicators, incubators, etc etc.

We ultimately come back to an old, old problem. Whilst it is quite
reasonable to live with one's oldies, and in fact the brief bits of time
that I have done this since not being there for five years are quite
tolerable, we come back to the fact that mum's a waste-of-space
clue-depleted fuckwit. She smokes like a burning tyre factory, and will
die within a happy timeframe. Many resources will then be released. Then
the real work begins, and I don't mean brewing beer. 

Other background: in-process of designing, for commercial mass
manufacture, an amusing gynaecological tool related to endoscopic surgery.
Have team of people at SWEC keen to trial it. $200 cheaper than current
item. Disposable (can't guarantee anything these days with prions being
autoclave proof!). 

> >Hmmm... the ram-patching stuff really appears to have got up your nose.

use very often and think is great, it works well, cheap to run, etc etc.

No, it isn't camouflage. I _am_ a clue-free loser, by most benchmarks of
clue-free and loser. Ok, I'm getting a toe in the water with php/postgres,
which is for the purpose of planting a seed in gnu-freeware-development
lant, but that is currently not significant and I will not say it is until
this is demonstrated to be the case.

It's nonetheless an accurate perception. Know any nonprofit orgs in Aust
which employ nonPhDs to do DNA manipulation for public or ecosystemic
benefit?

I've not seen any. There is some scope for infiltration into places which
are still using outdated tech, and which need to really start using dna
genotyping instead of westerns, etc. One in Canterbuty caught my
interests, have yet to investigate (Australian Chemical and Genetic
Technologies ... ACGT - with an acronym like that they'd have to be
fringe-heads).

No. In general, a small group of people spend a small amount of time
maintaining cat, hence it degenerates. We're mid-process of upgrading to
debian, which is much, much easier to maintain than redhat. I have learnt
a fuck of a lot doing some of it. 

Anyone can be so lame. Simple.

Your sensors are functioning correctly. 

Farting around with crap is how I learn about how things work/fail.
Observing the operation and failure modes of information systems interest
me especially, since the observations derived there apply to so many
things - societies, biological organisms (Read any R.A Fischer from about
1950 re total information content of a system? Amazing where it applies!).

A fine effort, in which I have contibuted slightly (oof). Estimated time
to start? Psst: want any AR grade lithium silicate?

Correct. it also takes less time to type than the actuality.

Find me somewhere totally depleted of depressing associations and I'll go
there. Know another M-class planet with cheap transport to get there?
Meantime, let me be the judge of where I am happiest.

I have my doubts. Cops will get axs to restricted things (hydrocarbons)

I am well aware of this, on a number of levels.

Yes. I wonder why that might be the case?

{huh? A: (blah blah) ? }

Whether or not you value my friendship, like me, or know (or fail to know)
why you give a rats about what the fuck I am doing (or not doing) is
mostly peripheral to how I determine what I actually do. 

I think myself worthwhile, etc, for reasons intrinsic to me and my 
awareness of my own nature. Externally-pegged self-esteem is just too
unreliable. 

I am doing what I fucking want.

I do not hassle you for:

- being a rent baron (quote from the late Mullet there); 

- assisting the continued detonation of the population bomb;

- working in and using your skills to assist the operation of an industry 
  which is largely there for the purpose of undemocratically extracting
  money from people who are susceptible to the delusion that gambling can
  make them wealthy (Assuming, possibly incorrectly, that you still do 
  stuff for a bunch o' dudes who engineer the guts of electronic poker
  machines) instead of, say, contributing to the free software movement,
  something to which I think you are considerably suited.


I am sorry to hear about the pain of your enshacklement to Ra. Why on
earth did you ever get involved with anyone in such a way as didn't enable
you to back out cleanly?

Maintaining a metabolism is a necessary precursor to doing things later.
I do not particularly care if my doing this offends you.

So... not quite as passively as you'd think. Trawled the journals for
anything to do with integrons lately? Using stem cells is one thing -
corporately owned, already telomere degraded - upgrading your entire cell
set via a self-distributing stripped down DNA plasmid is another thing
entirely. I need awareness of proteins and DNA tags which do the following
things, but why do all the work when there's already thousands of others
doing it for me?

1) port (up to megadalton sized) dsDNA directionally across eukaryote cell
membranes. 2) fail to arouse the suspicion of a whole range of
immunosystemic surveillance 3) express, in a regulated manner, protein
payloads of choice for various cytological optimisation tasks (whatever
... error correction? free-radical scavenging? telomere repair? toxin
degradation? hormone expression? Whatever u like). 

I need to encode this in DNA in such a way that 4) euk cells replicate it
and dump it into the cytoplasm and 5) direct protein in 1) to the outer
cell membrane so the entire DNA construct upon which this is encoded will
travel from cell to cell. Oh, I have to remember that certain DNA
sequences themselves are immunostimulatory so I have to modify it so it
doesn't promote its own destruction by virtue of its own nucleotidyl
sequence. Oh, and it's a self-interested replicator, I need to get it to
not simply degrade into a parasite. 

The human genome has been sequenced. Others are being sequenced. I am
aware that the molecular tools to do what I want to do are mostly already
around (the protein is step 1 is missing, inadequate voltage-gated
analogues exist in prokaryotae and also some bacterial plant pathogens)
but people who have no idea of its consequences are looking for just the
sort of directional, ATP-driven DNA porter I need). 

I chose to do Hons in a virus lab. With a big, difficult to work with,
hard to get a result from, (and guaranteed not to get you Hons1 and axs to
govt funded PhD scheme) gene for incorporation into DNA vaccine of the
mouse analogue of a virus with which I am already infected, which is also
sequenced, and for which I therefore possess the code. Ever wonder why?

I am involved in the operation of an ISP which is not coprorately run,
which is mirrored in another country, which uses an OS which is not
corporate/closed/proprietary. Ever wonder about that, or how it relates to
the previous paragraph?

Many of the macroscopic tools are within easy financial reach and I
already know, and have used, the techniques I'll have to use to build the
construct. Better: If I want, it'll be transferable from human to human...
unlike stem cells from a given individual.

This is free, and freely transferrable, software upgrades to the mammalian
metabolic OS. Fuck transplants, ESS's and other cut'n'paste-isms. 

You are well aware of the scale of probable consequences if such a
construct works in vivo. Wanna off someone, and do it in such a way as
forensic gits will never know? Encode on the construct a certain ribosome
inhibiting 70kDa albumen protein on it (You can guess which one), plus
caspases and DNA ligases so the construct is self-erasing. Wanna live for
a long long time? Do all those things I mentioned seven paragraphs ago
(telomere repair, etc).

I need time to think about this stuff. Filling my head with the sort of
shit which comes with a regular 9-5 grind is not conducive to this.

Until the porin I want is discovered, or such software as can design it
for me exists (seen any of the advances in genetic algorithm design
lately?), I trawl the journals, and I wait. That is basically what the
fuck I am doing.

Meanwhile, the primary intervening idiocy is the getting of a premises and
the cutting of liabilities to govt, utilities, and related unaccountable
parasites. These will come. Secondary idiocies include people asking me
what the fuck I am doing with my life.

When you try to explain to people the stuff about Farnsworth, ball
lightning, etc, even some of the brighter ones (Ed, etc) conclude you're
building a nuke weapon in your shed. Fuck knows what they'd think I'm
doing were I to attempt to tell them. Turn myself into an amoeba?

Why do I not fully answer people when they ask me what my plan is? It's a
time and effort vs. low likely probability of comprehension and high
probability of stupid comments equation.

Now you know. Don't ask me again.
