Hi there !!

Well some more hardware changes and a couple of questions.

Miklos has donated some SDRAM memory, 2 modules of 64MB, which has improved
the 3 PCs quite a lot. we put them on CAS and FLAT. Thanks a lot Miklos,
that's really awesome

So the situation for the Windows boxes is:

CAS:              233MH/64MB SDRAM, HD 2656MB
FLAT:            233/64MB SDRAM,
DIGGIE:        ???/128MB SDRAM
SCANNER    166/64MB DIMM, HD 2656MB

I saw another motherboard on the TV and I though that could suit well on
Scanner, but to be honest, I prefer a machine with 64MB than a faster one
with only 32MB, and I guess the scanner itself agrees with me. Suggestions?

Johnj told me that Diggie has problems sometimes, freeze or Blue screens. I
tried to look for a BIOS update, but I wasn't succeful, I need some
information: The manufacturer, model of the mobo. I guess that could be
written somewhere inside, but may be someone knows this. On the other hand I
have been testing the machine and I didn't have any problems at all, so
Johnj and rest, if you find any issue with it could you specify wich
program(s) where you using, OS, when did that happen,... some info like this
could be very useful.

In addition I have been speaking with some people and they are quite
interested about learning. I am pretty keen to start with them, but I need
to know if is posible to 'erase' any of this computers. I was thinking that
Flat could be the one, do you reckon?

Finally I have receive a computer from Miklos but it is missing some parts
(Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor). Could I grab some of this from CAT? This is for
personal use.

Furthermore I know some people that would be very interested in an old
machine, I am talking about people with low income and few resources, I was
wondering if could be possible make some computers for the old mobos that
are piled up and give it by donation or something like this.

See you.

Salva
