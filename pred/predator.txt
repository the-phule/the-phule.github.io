"The search for truth is predatory. It is a literal hunt, a conquest.
 There is that exemplary instant in Book IV of The Republic, when Socrates
 and his companions in discourse corner an abstract truth. They halloo,
 like hunters who have unearthed and run down their quarry.... [even if
 enjoined from the scientific quest,] somewhere at some moment, a man
 alone, a group of men addicted to the drug of absolute thought, will be
 seeking to create organic tissue, to determine the nature of heredity, to
 produce the cloud-chamber full of quarks. Not for renown, not for the
 benefit of the human species, not in the name of social justice or
 profit, but because of a drive stronger than love, stronger than even
 hatred, which is to be interested in something. For its own enigmatic
 sake. Because it is there."
