Urodynamics machine: archive assessment.

1) Hardware:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
486-dx4 100MHz circa 1990 8Mb ram, 1.281Gb harddisk. This is probably slow
but if the machine does its job adequately, don't change it. Maybe add
some more RAM... if the old style 30-pin RAM is still available!

Hardware (observed with tomsrootboot linux): 
hda (C:/ drive) is a 1223Mb Seagate IDE harddisk. 
hdd (D:/ drive) is a CD-ROM drive.

Presence of hdd indicates free primary slave and secondary master
IDE channel so additional harddisks, CD-burners, etc can be added.

No network card. Some unused hardware also, eg: sound card. Leave alone,
harmless.

One might consider the reliability of harddisks after ten years of use:
Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of a harddisk from 1990 is estimated to
be around 60,000 hours of continuous use. 

There are 8760 hours per year, but this machine is probably turned off at
least two thirds of the time. Hence, 2890 usage hours/year. Ten years use
at this rate is 28,900 elapsed hours of use per decade. I'll assume this
harddisk has a decade of useful life ahead of it. However, failure
probability increases with age. Archiving the data is a sensible
idea. This can be achieved internally or externally. Choices exist about
what to archive and where to archive it.


2) Software:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filesystem id# is 6 (Windows95 / DOS 16-bit>=32M) according to linux fdisk
The sole Windows95 filesystem exists on /dev/hda1 (which is C:/ partition)

Presently the harddisk is less than half full! 
Used space: 536Mb. Free space: 684Mb

If the rate of addition of new patient files is assumed to grow only
slowly this system will run out of space in about ten years - this assumes
the system took ten years to accumulate its existing total load of data,
and also takes into account that much of the system contains files which
are not patient records.

In the worst case, a new patient entry contains .240Mb. 
Hence: 4.26 patients can be fitted per megabyte, so assuming the size of
each record stored does not increase, the records of at least 2900
additional patients can be accommodated on this system. Over ten years
this is 290 new patients a year (less than 6 per week in a 52 week year).

Lots of useless files on harddisk: MS Encarta, for example. If more free
space is needed, delete this material.


3 Things to be archived:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Options:
a) Win95 Operating System
b) Urodynamics software
c) Urodynamics patient data

a) The Windows95 operating is no longer supported by Microsoft. If no
original installation disks remain, it should be archived. The
urodynamics software is thought to execute adequately under MS-DOS 6.22
so preservation of Win95 is not critical to maintenance of the urodynamics
system.

b) Assuming the urodynamics software can be reinstalled from its
installation disks, it does not need to be archived. HOWEVER, if no such
installation disks remain, the urodynamics software MUST be archived or
the patient data will not be readable after a disaster, even if archived,
since nothing would remain to read it. It takes less than 10Mb in total.

c) Patient data files need archiving, since only one copy presently
exists. The urodynamics patient data files are in c:/uro/patients. They
are named with eight digit hexadecimal names in no apparent order. There
is a total of 230 Megabytes - easily allocated on a single CD-ROM Each
patient has three files associated with their entry: The filenames for
each patient are all the same, but the suffix varies, there are .dbf .dbt
and .trc files. The earliest are circa 1990. The largest file is
patients.dbf (416kb) (a one-off central database) The largest file type is
.trc (max 224kb, minimum 64k) and is probably graphical in nature.



Where to archive:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The archive, at a minimum of 230Mb, is impractical to store on floppy
disks or LS-120 Zip drives. 

1) In-Situ
One can generate an archive within the machine itself, to a second
harddisk, which can be installed in the existing machine. This has the
advantage that the existing harddisk can continue to be used with no
interruption.

If the c:/uro/patients directory becomes corrupt, the urodynamics software
can be pointed to d:/uro/patients (the cdrom drive would be renamed to
e:/) and operations continued as normal from the archives on the second
harddisk. This approach has a vulnerability: catastrophic failures will
destroy both drives and the records on both. Removable harddisks exist for
this reason - archives can be written to them and the archive (and the
harddisk on which it is placed) can removed to another location. Modern
IDE harddisk are massive (at least 20,000 megabytes) and this
will be more than adequate for any conceivable archive on this system.

2) CD-ROM
One can also write the archive to a CD-ROM, which is advantageous in that
the CD-ROM archive can be stored off-site. However, once written to, it
can only be read thereafter. This method requires a CD-ROM burner and
software to drive it under Windows 95. To employ a CD-ROM archive, the
files on the CD-ROM would need to be moved back to a harddisk to which the
Urodynamics software could write new data. 

Since this archive represents ten years of accumulated data I'd recommend
at least one offsite copy somewhere. 

When to archive:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weekly. Straightforwardly executed under the In-Situ option (above), with
Windows Explorer's copy function, from C:/uro/patients to D:/uro/patients. 
It might take the machine a little while to move the files from C:/ drive
to D:/ drive.
