Mike,

Three things for you to do:

1. Read-    http://www.joevialls.co.uk/vialls/laetrile1.html
2. Read attached file. Not that I care if you don't.
3. Try to avoid alienating everyone you know,
    in the time you have remaining.


I wanted to send you the laetrile article today, and hold off
'final.txt' for a week or so. But heck, you're just going
to killfile this email account too. And I couldn't be bothered
creating a new one every time.

OK.
Now you read this, closely. Don't bother reading it in
'repy' mode, or touching the keyboard, since this time
_I'm_ not interested in your comments - not of that kind.

You began the first of your two attacks with the title
'hostile interrogation' - an interpretation that was entirely
your own, and fucking wrong. There was no 'interrogation', you
just twisted events and my words into that in your mind.
Building up some curiousity on my part about one person (them,
not you) into an illusion of some calculated attack on your
precious 'Total Personal Privacy' fetish.

Nor was there any hostility, anywhere in sight, either in my mind
or actions, until _now_. So far as I was concerned, you were an old
friend and a good friend, suddenly in need of every bit of help and
cheerfulness and support I could give you.

Now, I've had some days to think calmly about your words and the
attitudes behind them. Hostility? You've got it now. Enjoy the
real thing.
Frankly, I now think that either you have a brain tumor and its
affecting the way you think, or you have revealed yourself to be
a callous, self-centered, empathy challenged, selfish, extremely
rude, incredibly arrogant, bad tempered, childish and conceited
person.
With some pretty weird obsessions about maintaining extreme privacy
in anything to do with your social life too.




I didn't reply _directly_ to 'hostile interrogation', since I thought
I'd give you an opportunity to back off that insane 'don't reply to
these violent and unfair attacks or I'll killfile you' bullshit.

Now I will. You can stick this other email address in your killfile
too, for all I care. It will save me a lot of effort and sadness over
the coming interval of your dying, that I won't need to be concerned
with the messy details.

The best thing about all this is that I can say "fuck off and die" -
and not only mean precisely that, but you will do it too.

Thats so big of you. Too bad you put an equal amount of effort into
trashing an old friendship over a couple of paragraphs of text that
_you_ chose to get upset about, even though any fool could see they
were written in friendly chat mode, not even faintly expecting them
to be insulting or offensive. Yeah, it turned out to be a minefield.
The landmines consist of your exagerated touchyness. Most people, me
included, would have just said 'gee, was I that obvious?' and not even
blinked otherwise. Fuck man, you were _totally_ focussing on your mobile,
and obvously itching to get to dealing with it. And you can't figure out
why your dad picked it up? Idiot!

Then you shoot me, for trying to explain why I noticed! Moron!

Yeah, I learn. That you are far more touchy and flamable than I ever
imagined. About things most people would just grin and shrug about.
And that when angry, you can be an utter bastard.
Also that some concepts such as concern for another's feelings (even
if mistaken) are clearly far beyond you.


>TISM encapsulate it best:
>
>"How would you like to be told about the cocks your mother sucked?"
>-TISM "Ozymandias" -Machiavelli and the Four Seasons.

Reading that, I thought, 'My god, what the hell is wrong with Pred?'
Thats a straw man - attribute an action to your 'opponent' thats far
worse than anything they actually did, then attack them as if they'd
really done it.

A _very_ unfair argument tactic, generally only used by bastards.
Big surprise you'd do it.

Back to facts for a moment, putting aside stupid theatrics.

The central problem, for you, is that I happened to guess that an
ex-girlfrined of mine had SMSd you. And that you had plans for that
evening, maybe involving her. (And cut out all the 'you thought I was
going to screw her' crap - I had no idea, didn't care, didn't pry,
didn't say or write anything about that. You read it in - stupidly.)

So, I happened to _very_ mildly kid you about it. I've mentioned that
I was doing this only because I was worried you might be feeling a
bit guilty about going out with someone you know I still care about.

Yes, I guess I misread 'guilt' into your behaviour, since you've made
it quite plain that you're incapable of grasping such concepts - either
that you might feel guilty about seeing someone I still miss, _or_ that
I might want to assure you there was no cause to. Yes, its clear that
you do not suffer from the handicap of empathy. Or loyalty to friends
either.

No wonder your immediate thought when this matter first came up was
that you were now 'the enemy'. Guess you can't conceive that others
might think differently.


Also, btw (and I didn't mention this before) I chose to leave abruptly,
so you could get on with your evening. Oh, but that was a crime right?
That I'd noticed you were impatient to get on with your evening.
I shouldn't have dared to interpret your fucking so-private body
language, and should have just sat there chatting till you asked me
to leave, right? Fuck you.

>>Oh, I dunno. If you'd not had the other two calls, I bet I'd have

>Dude, Xiu's NOT my mother. She does me the courtesy of not giving a shit
>what I do when she's not around. You were reading WAY, WAY too much into
>the fact that my fone was ringing.

And you, are reading way, way too much into the fact that I thought
about it at all.

If you are going to get enraged when people wonder whats going on when
you focus on your phone, act secretive and possessive about it, and get
a series of calls in quick succession, then how about you turn the
dammed thing off when in company? Cos otherwise you just set up a trap
for your friends to fall into.

Also, your whole case rests on the idea that even if I guessed it
was Xiu (who'd we talked about quite comfortably during the day)
still I should have ignored the possibility. That you'd expect me
to say nothing then, displays such an incredible denial of human
nature, that I'm flabergasted. Hey, hello, I'm still in love with
her. Did you notice me crying a little that day, talking about her?
Probably not, since in your world, its a crime to notice any such
thing as other people's feelings.

If Joss phoned me when you were around, and I acted like it was
important, but a secret, and you guessed it was her, and when you
showed curiosity I flew off the handle and told you to get fucked,
mind your own business, and btw don't ever speak to me again - you'd
be surprised too. At least.

Heck, you'd _volunteered_, without my even asking, that you'd made her
come. (And that was a *really* stupid, thoughtless, and empthy-depleted
thing to tell me, btw. I'd told you the story about that, you knew it
was something quite important to me. Talk about stepping into minefields.)
When I politely (no 'hostile interrogation') mentioned I'd appreciate
hearing _how_, you quite happily let me know. And also told me very
personal stuff about your own state, also from only a polite 'how are
you now' query - following up on the _last_ time you volunteered more
than I wanted to know.

Plus I'd told you quite a bit about my own past experiences and
problems with her. And explained at length that it really hurt to
hear you'd succeeded, but also that it was just a general pain,
nothing against you.

All of which you'd taken in stride, no problems.

So how the *FUCK* am I supposed to guess you'd be so hypersensitive
about mere mention of my guessing (and how) that you *might* be going
out with her that night? Its just so outrageously unfair...

As for the consequences of your thoughtless blab about making Xiu come-
I have no idea what you were thinking of, but you obviously didn't
think it through. Did you think I'd ever be able to speak to her
again, without eventually letting it slip that I knew?

The girl I love more than anything else in the world, even if I do
think intellectually that she's hopelessly incompatible, and I've
given up on ever having her back. But did you think I'd be able to
keep that secret from her - that I knew that? That I could chat away
happily with her, never mentioning my joy that she had finally achieved
something so central to love, and that had once been a precious dream
of mine to give her? Even if I _knew_ for sure that she'd hate to hear
that I knew - still, I could never keep that secret.

Well, you might have been able too, being apparently unconcerned by
things like truth and love and such.

But I... cannot keep secrets from those I love. Or like.
I believe it is evil to even try.

Anyway, if that one came around to hit you in the face, blame yourself.
You should have kept your own mouth shut. Ironic, that you are blasting
me for saying too much, when the one thing that could really
hurt you in a practical sense (Xiu's friendship with you) is
directly the result of your own big mouth and thoughtlessness.
While everything I said and wrote to you was of no practical
consequence at all - you just chose to get offended by it.

I wouldn't be surprised, if in fact your sudden flaming rage was
due not to my email comments to you, but to encountering Xiu's
reaction to that 'information leak' _you_ created. Cut you off,
has she? And you are furious, and too gutless to admit it was your
own fault, and are just generally directing it at me, and using
my comments about you and your phone as a substitute target.
Look in a mirror next time you feel like shouting "Fool!"

>
>Yes. Very. Don't turn it on again in my presence, ever. Or anyone
>else's actually, it's VERY VERY broken. As in, a hazard to the operator.

Only in the presense of unsignposted explosives.

Yes, I promise to never again bother to try and do anything good for
you. I won't try and notice if you might be feeling down about something,
and try to help with it. I won't make any effort to explain that I was
trying to be nice, when you start attacking me for trying anything at
all. In fact, none of these things will happen, because I don't expect
or wish to interact with you at all.

In the rest of my Mike-free life, I'll continue to do my best to
feel what others are thinking or wanting, and try to be considerate,
thoughtful and cheering in their presense. For all your insulting rhetoric,
I'm glad of what sensitivity I do have, and am glad of the many times
its been an aid in helping others be happy. I'm ashamed of the times
I've missed messages I should have seen, and I'm determined to improve.
Thanks for the book ref, I've ordered it (and some others.)

Logical inversion. You meant to say "Even if they _did_ [relate] to someone
[Guy loves], what business... etc"

A key point. Yes, none of my business. But - unbelievably stupid, callous
and selfish of you to expect me to be silent in that case.
Someone (not Xiu) recently said to me "I don't think Pred has _ever_ been
in love, has he?" The context was a discussion of your apparent complete
indifference to human emotions. I said, that yes, I did think you had
been, in the last few years. No details.
I may have been wrong. You certainly act as if you have no idea. Despite
all the angst of your writing about Joss.


>yer trap shut. See also default setting for anyone who makes such an
>uncalled-for conjecture: fuck off smartarse.

Here's some _more_ detail you'll hate to hear. That Sunday I was still
smarting from Xiu having informed me just a couple of days before, that
she would not, after all, be seeing me _that_Sunday_. Which was why I
had it free to go draining with you.
So, the question of what she was doing that day was kind of on the back
of my mind. Now, if it had turned out that her plan was to see you that
night, do you think I'd have been upset?
Big surprise! NO! I'd have felt much better about things. She'd been
quite abrupt in dashing my hopes of seeing her, after definately building
me up in anticipation - and that hurt. But I'd rather she spent an evening
with you than me. (Past tense in the 'rather', btw.) Better for everyone.

And it would make me feel less bad about her abruptness and lack of
explanation. She wouldn't want to tell me about going out with you - of
course, & fair enough. So I could put the abruptness down to that, instead
of her just wanting to be hurtful/discouraging to me.

But this is probably all way too subtle for you. No doubt you are
simply feeling enraged that I'd dare to even think about your social
life, or that I'd be feeling glad that my friend, with not much time
left, should be enjoying himself. So _intrusive_ of me!

Oh, and to make sure you don't start obsessing again about whether
I'm thinking about you shagging her, I happen to generally skirt
around that concept (except when you rub my nose in it by telling
me you got her off), and just think about what great fun she is to
be with, and talk with. When I talk about 'spending an evening with Xiu'
thats exactly what I think of - an evening of her wonderful company.

You are being such an idiot here, and so uncharacteristicly, that it

More idiocy.
Just because of one instance of my walking into a Predator-sensitivity-trap,
complete with camoflage of prior intimate discussions that seemed far
more personal than what you are going apeshit about, you declare
that I'm bound to be treading on everyone's toes?
Fuck you.

When Ra reads something about my feelings that I'd rather she hadn't,
I just resign myself to having been so transparent.
When I see something she's hiding, and I can do something to improve
things, I do. Its helped a great deal, many times.
If I see something I guess she'd rather not be mentioned, I don't.

There was no way I could have guessed you'd be so sensitive about
what you were doing that night, and hate my mentioning that it was
obvious you had something planned. Most people are not hyper-sensitive
about dates. What, is this some weird private boy's school hangup?
Nobody allowed to admit that Mike goes out with girls?
Kidding you about it is forbidden?
I had no idea you were such a child.

Your whole point, that no one should ever even try to sense whats on
other people's minds, or act on such perceptions, is utter, childish,
immature, antisocial, crap.

More crap. I have no intention of using such perceptions as an aid
in lying to friends. Enemies, yes.

As for 'convincing me of my correctness' - what the hell is wrong with you?
Did I ever say anything to you other than "*if* that was Xiu...blah..."
You never said it was, I just thought it seemed probable. Oh, and till
now I'd forgotten that bit where I suggested to you about sending Xiu a
reply saying 'hi from Guy' - I was joking btw. Knew there was no way you
would. But the way you replied verified that it was her, very clearly.
_That_ convinced me I was _probably_ correct. Not my intuition.

And all this while, you didn't say anything about how it was none of my
business, etc - you just kind of grinned and rolled eyes. Nothing to
tell me you hated me mentioning her, or whatever. More laying of landmines
for later email conversation.

I did say "I know who that was" but then, nothing stopped you replying
"no you don't" or something like that.

Thanks for the ref. Plenty of others on Amazon too.
As for 'stop now' - what a stupid thing to say. All skills take a while
to learn. Most of my life I've been handicapped by being poor at
this. Having you go bananas because I offend some hyper-sensitive
phobia you have about others making any mention at all of your
social life, is _not_ a good reason for me to give up.
And no, thats the first time the situation has ever arrisen where
I tried to explain what I'd noticed, and how, and why I was noticing.
It only happened in the context of prior conversations, and relationships.
None of which you seem to take into account.



>>Lets see, to illustrate (please excuse personal comments):
>
>DANGER: personal comments are NOT excused. You are calling me to

IDIOT! I am NOT 'calling you to account'. You are projecting. I never
at any point offered any negative opinion about your evening's plans.
Had no such opinions. None. Its your life, etc.

>accountable. If you are doing this solely to demonstrate expertise in a
>newfound skill, or not, it is still FUCKING ANNOYING.

More 'brain tumor suspect' stuff. Paranoia. At no point, ever, did I
do or say _anything_ that could be construed as 'calling to account'.
Two or three cheerful jokes about your maybe evening with Xiu, then later
when you say 'you're wrong' I briefly relate how I came to guess that.

>It's annoying generally. In this case it's specifically annoying because
>you're still interested in Xiu, and have your antennas up information for
>EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HER,

Yes. OF COURSE. Idiot.

>which now includes me.

Indirectly, yes. Ain't that a bitch. But, did I ask "are you going out with
her?" No. I just kidded you a little about the possibility, attempting to
let you know I felt no ill will. This concept, of friendly good will, seems
to be beyond you.

>If you think my life revolves around her, you are mistaken.

Hello, Mr brain tumor.
Why on earth do you even raise this idea? Of course it doesn't.
You are not in love with her. Said so, plus its obvious in your
behavior (gasp! more body language!) Plus, I know she is not your
type. Nor will she fall for you, any more than me again.
You have other concerns now. Another love interest, and other
friends (though that number is now down by one.)

>An example of your broken reasoning in this area might be, for example:

'broken reasoning' is not a term you should attempt to weild
in this discussion.

>Guy observes: pred gets on motorbike, rides off.
>Guy thinks: pred is off to shag Xiu.

This is another 'straw man'. No such event happened, nor would I
think that if I did see you ride off.


>Um, no. The two correlate, but not predictably. Voicing conjecture that
>this is the case is *bloody annoying*. It's just not your call to make.

Lets remind ourselves that what happened is this:
Pred & Guy spend day draining, and happen to talk about Xiu.
  (Since she's Guy's lost love, and Pred boasted of having got her off.)
Pred clearly wants to get home by a certain time.
Once home, Pred becomes focussed on phone.
Phone SMS rings, three times in short interval.
Guy jokes its Xiu (mostly because Guy is thinking a lot of her.)
Pred effectively confirms, certainly does not deny.
Pred's phone attention even prompts his dad to tease him about it.
Pred shows signs of impatience, need to deal with phone stuff.
Guy politely takes leave, so Pred can get on with it,
and on way out Guy says "If thats Xiu, have a good time!"
Later, you go ballistic when I innocently try to explain
my thoughts of the time.

Fine. Not my call to make. Feel free to abuse me for trying
to be considerate and thoughtful, and not knowing you had an
extreme privacy fetish.

And you are a stupid, arrogant cunt.

I presume he did it because the way you were acting made the phone the
center of everyone's attention. I don't care what you think about that
statement, it was the case. _You_ teased him into doing it.

Idiot. Because I was there, and he wanted it done, but didn't want you
up a ladder. Don't even bother trying to understand this if it isn't

Insulting that you's assume I'd forgotten. Stupid that you'd equate
the two situations.
Actually, it seemed to me that he wasn't even trying to read the phone,
just tease you about it. Which is something entirely different.

Fuck, I hope you have that head scan soon. The reasoning ability of
the person writing to me, is not at all up to the standards I expect
from the Mike I know.

Straw man #4, combined with a bait-and-switch.
I joked an SMS was Xiu. Big deal. We'd been talking about her on and
off all day. You knew she was on my mind, and why. You confirmed by actions.
Otherwise I did none of those, attempted none.


>Get it into your head man. There's a reason cryptography is
>popular. It's cos people DONT WANT THEIR MESSAGES READ or guessed by
>random other people. Like YOU.

This is just blind anger speaking. No point writing it, other than
for the insult in the assumption I don't know it. Like the little
personal touch at the end - Guy is the generic hostile party.

Well, I am now. Congratulations.

If you really do turn out to have a brain tumor, I'll change my mind.

And I only picked up on a _public_channel_ - the way you were acting.
Its information that cannot be avoided - it just arrives in one's
mind, already interpreted, like all other visual & audible signals.

You do it to me too. I could give a few recent examples, but couldn't
be bothered with the amount of writing involved.



>You've spent this week asking me personal questions about Xiu, and when I

Exageration. I asked you a small number of questions. While giving
you much more. And you gave me more information than I asked for.
Plus, we talked of many other things, Xiu was only touched on now
and then.

>give you personal details you get upset.

Plain innacurate. Apart from _one_ bit of information, I was glad to
hear everything you told me. And anyone with half a brain would have
known that _one_ thing would inevitably make me feel miserable.
A big "Bzzzt! Fail!" for Mike's commonsense and consideration of
other people's feelings.


>You wish I didn't tell you that I got her off - for good reason.

Thats *right*. One true point in your whole tirade.

>You were not ready to know and I now know you never would be.

You twist into an insult, what is merely a truth of finer reasons.
Yes, I'd rather never have known. Why? You work it out.
Its not a matter of 'being ready' - which implies lack of maturity
or something.

You are an arsehole for chosing this topic to twist around.

>I shouldda kept that private.

Yes. I discussed previously how stupid and thoughtless you were.

>SOME MESSAGE CONTENT IS NOT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES.

What, your appending this truism is supposed to make you sound
smarter, or excuse your stupid mistake?


>Suppose you or dad DID pick my fone up, trawl the messages, and read,
>
>"Thanks for a great shag, want another one? 934875934875923"

Suppose I or your dad was a bastard, and would actually read your SMSs.
Strawman #5.

>What would either of you think.... would you be right... it wouldn't
>matter except that I'd be pissed off that you read this stuff without my
>say-so.

HERE IS A KEY POINT. PAY ATTENTION.
Thats right, it wouldn't matter at all. The 'hostile SMS reader' would
'discover' that Mike is a human being, and enjoys standard pleasures.
But, Mike would be 'pissed off' at the 'leaking' of this knowledge.

I think this is central to your present insanity.
So you feel its a big deal, that you are normal?
Its a secret? You get upset that other people might find out?
Worst of all, that your friends or (horrors!) parents, might discover
you actually spend time with girls?

Putting aside for the moment that detail that you'd already been talking
a lot to this particular ex-friend about doing just that, I still think
this is odd. I can think of plenty of other times and other people that
I'd had perfectly calm (or side splitting funny) conversations about
things like this. Whats _your_ problem?


If I was to guess, I'd say either some weird private school legacy,
or brain tumor. The second being more likely, given that it didn't
seem to bother you on Sunday, but a few days later, _something_
drives you to levels of spite and rage I've never seen from you.
You claim it was a few paragraphs of my text.

We'll see.

Have the head scan, dude.

Or if it was Xiu, telling you where to take yourself and your big
mouth, then don't vent your spleen on me.

No, idiot, I don't.
I'm (was) interested in hearing news of Xiu.
But not from you anymore, thanks.

I _was_ letting you tell me about your cancer, since I wanted to be
supportive. Give you someone to talk to about it, who wasn't going to
go all religious, or 'good luck', or 'I'm sure you'll be fine'.
Which I know you can do without.
See if you can find another listener with that attitude.
Also, how many other people do you know who can even vaguely keep up
with the technical details?

A really irrational one too.

Hmmm... Now, did I say anything to give them such an impression?
Mentioned her name, when joking about sending her a 'hi from Guy'...
So, I guess, they figure out I know her. But then, what does her
name give them? Did you once tell them all about the sad Xiu-Guy
tale? If so... who's leaking info, then?

Anyway, if I'd known you were hyper agro about keeping your parents
completely in the dark about your social life (which is not normal,
you know), then that counts as a real mistake, for which I'm
sorry.


I'm beginning to see why you've never had a serious girlfriend.
With attitudes like these, it would be impossible.

Ha ha ha! Oh, no wait, this is really sad. Mike you are nuts. He was
teasing. I think.

Otoh, very few people would be so _extremely_ uptight about the idea
of others seeing an SMS or two.

No.

"You can have my SMS when you pry it from my cold dead fingers?"
Could make for a good comedy sketch.

You really are suffering from *total* humour failure, combined with complete
loss of sense of proportion. Either your fate is getting to you, or a brain
tumor is.

You persist in assuming I was somehow attacking you in this.
To quote yourself, "Bzzzt! Fail!"
I merely list what was. No judgement or opinion involved.
You are supplying all the emotions - both what you attribute to me,
and your own violent reactions.

Ha ho ho ho! Yes, it is. But thats exactly what you were doing, almost
to the exclusion of all else. Which was why it was inescapably noticable,
to me, your dad, and perhaps your mum too.
That you were not actually answering the messages, but clearly wanted to,
just made it worse.

Bullshit. Idiot.
Something like:
Pred looks at Guy, smiles, says "nope! not this time"
would have saved a lot of trouble. But _you_ are too fucked up to
bother being open and informative to friends.

I already explained, twice I think, why I wanted to let you know I
didn't feel bad if it was Xiu. But that thinking involves empathy for
another person's feelings, so aparently eludes you. Hence you can't
see any valid reason for my saying anything. Fine, like I care anymore.
If I'd _known_ your prime concern was to maintain a wall of silence
around your secrets, I'd have kept quiet in front of your parents.

Hey, guess what, it wasn't annoying at all. Wrong, but who cares?
If you wanted to ask me about my own life, you'd get answers.
And if you joked about it in front of other people, I might ask
you to stop if it wasn't funny, but it wouldn't drive me nuts.

By the way, you keep volunteeing information I have no interest in

Very inconsistent to be on the one hand enraged that I read a few
little bits of info off your behaviour, but on the other hand _pass_
me lots of stuff of the same kind.


ONE MORE TIME, FOR THE HARD OF HEARING:
I don't care about your private life, dont even care if some of it
is with Xiu, and this whole pile of bullshit was started by me wanting
to reasure you - that I don't care. You have it completely arse about.


>Dude... are you perhaps waking up to the fact that the contents of DYD CAN
>TURN YOU INTO AN _INSUFFERABLE_ _ARSEHOLE_. No. Thought not. Never mind.

Stupid statement #314

Maybe try asking your dad if he thought you were highly focussed on
your mobile that arvo. If he'd remember. Or just recall that he teased
you about it then.
Then try blaming DYD for my noticing that you were, and daring to
intrude on your sacred total wall of privacy by wondering if that
was Xiu. Oh,and don't forget to blame DYD for me finding it hard to
forget her, when the DYD advice is to think 'Next!'

Humour failure.
Humanity failure.

Empathy failure.

One more time. The sole element of interest was whether it was Xiu, who I 
love.
The sole motivation for commenting, was to reassure you, that I didn't mind.
Acting under the misapprehension that you'd maybe be worried about that.
Take your 'fuck off', and shove it up your stupid, paranoid, self-centered

One of those non-questions one routinely ends with "Do tell."?

Fine. See if I care if it bloody eats you alive from one end,
while the cancer chews on the other end.
The second reason I thought you should get rid of it, is that its
fucking anti-social to spread tinea around. Every time I get it,
it makes the skin under my toes split deeply - extremely painful.
If I could ever identify some stupid lazy bastard who'd walked
around a wet floor, and I'd caught it from them, I'd fucking punch
the cunt out.

And _you_ are going to be spending some time in hospitals and such,
barefooted. Guess where other sick people will be too?

Antisocial, thoughtless cunt.
I can't believe you've been walking around with that for years.
Must make you real popular with your lovers, when they catch it
from their own bathroom floor.

She raised the idea of being friends again, not me. But it turns
out her idea of 'friends', is something strange that I'm not
interested in exploring.
Much to my sorrow. But less sorrow in the long run to shut her

expect a reply. Not from Xiu, anyway.

Huh? I rang you about 10.30am, Sunday morning.
To ask if you wanted to do the drain that day.
How was I to know you'd be in bed?
Much more likely you'd be out in garden or garage
or something. Hence long 'give him time' rings.

Not like you to get basic facts wrong.

>either. It's annoying. Stop after about 15 rings.

If I'm calling practically in the middle of the day,
and want to give someone time to hear it from outside
if they are home, then I'll let it ring till the phone
system cuts off.
I *hate* it when I hear phone from yard, run inside,
and it stops just as i'm reaching for it.

But not to worry. I won't be phoning you much, if at all.
Maybe in a few weeks to see how you are going, post-headscan.

I wasn't sure if you were joking. Early hours of morning, maybe
stoned. Due a lot of leeway. None for second instance of bastardry.

You think I want to remain friends with someone who makes threats

You've changed a hell of a lot over the years you've been mostly
silent, Pred.

Guess I'd make a poor transistor pair.
But, you declaring a boolean rule doesn't mean I have to pay any

You got a choice there, just like you 'gave' me.

I'm not going to bother with much of this crap.
Most everything already covered.
You don't comprehend that even love lost is still more important
to me than some strange hangup you have about maintaining absolute
crypto-standard total secrecy about trivial details like whether
you are going out with Xiu some evening. Which, I had no idea was
so important to you, until you explode in flames of abuse and issue
an ultimatum that would be fatal to any friendship.

I need a rubber stamp for this: I didn't care about the f-ing msgs,
just was curious if it was Xiu (keep your 'private life' crap to
yourself, you'd have done the same if situation reversed),
and wanted to let you know no bad feelings.

The answer, is no.
Though I was guilty of sending her unwanted emails, during the
terminal days of our relationship. Very rarely since.

Sigh. I didn't even send a christmas card.
Hmm... I wonder if I should send her a copy of this one?

But look who is talking about 'blabbing'.

Cutting off a friendship older than most of our assorted other
friendships, over three paragraphs of text, about 26 lines, that
don't even say anything rude, and were written simply to explain
why I'd thought something even if wrongly, certainly makes it clear.
