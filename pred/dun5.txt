Perhaps you'd like to think a bit more about the causes.
Or do we have to wait till you are asked to let down some friend, listen to
exagerated libel about them, and then told to lie to them to cover up other
people's actions, and then be abused for not liking it - before you
understand.

Which is perfectly normal. But we (and that was all of us) initially
decided that in this special case, that conditon would be put aside.
Then three of the particpants went back on their decison, when it came
to someone _they_ didn't like.

>hands up people if you now hate me for not inviting you on every dodgy
hardcore expo i've run, for excluding you from places that could only
handle groups of 2-3 people MAX, .

All fine.


>if you havn't been on a hardcore expo with me it might be because i just
don't know you closely enough - maybe get to know me before you start
hating me.

This isn't terribly relevent.


 [snip stuff about your job - you probably shouldn't mention it you know.]

All agreed though.
