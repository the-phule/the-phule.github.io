	Genetically Engineered Crops - Release Sites

Dear All,

The Office of Gene Technology Regulator did not list on their website, the
sites of release for genetically engineered organisms. (NB: commercial
sites will not be listed) We have therefore excerpted the site information
from the applications {except for PR 63 (3) and 85 (x) which did not work}
at:

http://www.ogtr.gov.au/gmorecord/ir.htm#irlist

Most of the information is incomplete because it does not include the exact
street addresses that were promised. Exact information from:

1800 181 030 or <ogtr@health.gov.au>

Shire information was provided under the old voluntary system and local
councils were advised of releases. Where this alone is given, it is
inadequate. OGTR has promised to provide an interactive map on their
website later.

Six applicants (Monsanto; Deltapine; Centre for Legumes in Mediterranean
Agriculture (CLIMA WA); U of Qld; Latrobe Uniand Glaxo Wellcome) have
applied for over 100 sites to remain secret, claiming commercial in
confidence. These claims will take up to 90 days to resolve and may then be
appealed, which could take several months longer. It appears to be a
stalling tactic.

The 'experimental' phase of many trials has been completed but the law
requires monitoring and decontamination of each site for up to three years
after completion and the same crop may not be grown there. During
inspections over the past 18 months, OGTR found many previous sites
mismanaged and contaminated.

Look over a fence near you to see how GE releases are going!

Best wishes,

Bob Phelps
