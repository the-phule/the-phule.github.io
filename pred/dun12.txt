Err... well, the Yahoo setup includes a 'moderator' power, and he
is it, currently. The queston is to what extent 'Mod' should wield
those powers. Is CC an anarchy, or not? Would we prefer a list in
which every post has to be OK'd by 'Mod' before being seen (as with
some such lists?) Or should we admit that the status till now has
been working fine: we mostly try to keep off topic posts to a min,
and try to avoid abusing each other. But accept that now and then
issues/event arise that are contentious, and there will be bun
fights over them.

This one looks like its mostly over, leaving only the matter of how
the hell we are going to still do expos there despite the risks,
bad feelings and 'clique sitting on the map' problems.

Agreed. But then, lots of people are showing new sides to themselves
these days, aren't they?

I'm not sure why you think thats harmful to the group? They'd otherwise
just be doing it by phone and in small groups (and still do.)

Um ahem. I seem to remember some rather heated comments from Drac to
me, over a joke I once made about wet t-shirts on an expo. But never mind.

Don't you think it would be less contentious to simply switch your
yahoo settings to 'no email', and read now and then via the web page?

The proportion of posts in various categories varies from day to day.
Arguments come in random waves. Its inevitable, given free posting.

Sigh. Lets hear you say 'its just personal' after seeing this location.

>Now saying this, im not personally attacking you Diode. Not at all.

Why not? :-) Go ahead, say what you think.
As far as I'm concerned, truth and openness rates way higher than
'social form and manners'.

Only three pages? Hell, I must have written 30.
So, without an open forum, people will be able to _do_ any dammed stupid,
harmful and destructive things, and no one will be able to 'flame, whinge,
insult and threaten' in response? Whats going to be the 'accepted form'
for expressing disapproval? "Oh jolly poor show, old chap!"

>Trying to garner public support for negitive purposes dosent solve 
>anything, it just pisses people off.

'Negative purposes', such as exposing other's negative actions, so
maybe we all learn a lesson and don't do that again?

How negative is stuff like "Oh We can't invite Rodent, because he'll
tell Milsey, and anyway he took the blah blah blah" ??? And I agreed
at the time, or at least went along with it! What was I thinking?
There is a huge, vital lesson here - this sort of 'secret inner group'
stuff just *sucks* unbelievably. If anyone ever spots _me_ having
any part of such a thing again, shoot me please.


Why do I keep feeling we've had this exact same argument re
yahoo posts before?
