In the course of research a number of informants have told me that they
use single doses of SSRI anti-depressants in order to boost the effect of
ecstasy.  They claim this is effective although scientifically dubious.
 
I am however interested in reports from two other informants who were
using Moclobomide (Aurorix), an MAOI anti-depressant, for the
'legitimate' treatment of depression.  They report that ecstasy use, even
at very small doses, while on the MOA causes "memory blackouts" that last
up to 5 hours.  One reported that the effect was similar to sleep
walking.  Friends described an elaborate evening where a number of
different venues where visited.  He apparently accompanied them but had
no later recollection of the evening.  Both participants felt disturbed
by these episodes and were worried what may have become of them if not
accompanied by friends.
 
I was wondering if anyone knows of any described interaction between
Moclobomide and Ecstasy? Supposition by clinicians or toxicologists would
also be welcome. If such an interaction is common there are obvious
implications for harm minimisation in advising people against mixing E
and MAOIs.
 
I am also specifically interested in how long Mocobemide users would need
to "holiday" from the anti-depressant before Ecstasy.  For example both
participants have said they intend to take ecstasy over the New Year
period and wondered if they might not suffer the previous side effects if
they suspended their Moclobemide a could of days before.
