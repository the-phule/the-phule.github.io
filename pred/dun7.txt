Subject: Re: (C/C) NEWS FLASH! - Memoirs of the Secret Six

Yeah.

If it came across that I was including Onetel or Curly in my
criticisms, sorry. 'Dignified silence' pretty much sums up their
part in all this, whether or not giving a damm. At the meeting,
I got the impression they were both a bit embaressed at the
whole business of excluding this or that person for whatever
reason. Me too.
And it was a shame that Onetel couldn't add his friend to the
invite list, but seemed fair enough to me, since all the CC
people going would be depending on each other (known quantities)
to not fuck up and get us all into big trouble.

My only (slight) complaint is that neither of them offered
any support during the 'three people beat on Diode for his
backing up a friend' thing. But then, I can understand their
position.

Sorry about the time sink.

Diode
