This is John Hoffman, author of THE ART AND SCIENCE OF DUMPSTER DIVING.
I just wanted to let you know I picked up on your chatter and I think
you guys are AWESOME! The very notion of coordinating information about
good dive sites by posting it upon a website...revolutionary. I've just
written a sequel that's all finished, totally complete and being printed
right now, but what you've done is so revolutionary that I'll have to go
back into the text and insert a discussion about it. Keep up the good
work. What you've done fires my imagination so much that I think I've
thought of my third book, which is going to be about dumpster diving
AROUND THE WORLD. Your comment about how my book doesn't address
Australian conditions really made me think...I should write a book about
dumpster diving around the world, using information from people all over
the world. So feel free to send it to me, though can't say when I'll get
it done, exactly. JOHN HOFFMAN
