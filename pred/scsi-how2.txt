Yes, they definitely want comma delimited entries. The way that the module
interface works is that parameters are assigned directly into named
variables inside the kernel module, either as an integer, or an array of
integers. So:

options blah ioport=2 irq=5

sets the value of the variable named ioport to 2 and that named irq to 5,
then starts up the module. OTOH,

options blah list=3,5

sets list[0] to 3 and list[1] to 5.

Indeed. I meant to say, look in aha152x.c.

And this is the most relevant bit we find:

...
 SYMBOLS FOR MODULE CONFIGURATION:

 aha152x=IOPORT,IRQ,SCSI_ID,RECONNECT,PARITY,SYNCHRONOUS,DELAY,EXT_TRANS
 configuration override of first controller


 aha152x1=IOPORT,IRQ,SCSI_ID,RECONNECT,PARITY,SYNCHRONOUS,DELAY,EXT_TRANS
 configuration override of second controller
...

OK. Note, BTW, that "device or resource busy" pretty well just means that
the module didn't load successfully.

Yep, my mistake. I misunderstood modules_info and aha152x.c. What I should
have suggested was:

sudo /sbin/modprobe aha152x aha152x=0x340

Yep.

Nope.
