Well, you know they can always add "Walk from drain $776" as on offense.

Maybe there can be a subsection of the Clan called the 776 crew. People
who float from drains. 

"Yo, man I heard you were in the 776 posse! Hard core."

Pay _close_ attention. I am fucking cranky about this. I have gone to a
lot of effort to make several important points in the following
transaction. Nobody else will bother making them, they'll simply cut you
out of their life. If you even think of replying to it in explanation or
question mode, I will killfile your email address, return your stuff, and
lock you out of my life. Got it? Don't even try. I removed the question
marks from the whole rant just to make sure you get the point that I
expect you not to ever comment on this again. Shut up. Read. Learn. Learn
fast. 

TISM encapsulate it best:

"How would you like to be told about the cocks your mother sucked?"
-TISM "Ozymandias" -Machiavelli and the Four Seasons.

Dude, Xiu's NOT my mother. She does me the courtesy of not giving a shit
what I do when she's not around. You were reading WAY, WAY too much into
the fact that my fone was ringing.

Yes. Very. Don't turn it on again in my presence, ever. Or anyone
else's actually, it's VERY VERY broken. As in, a hazard to the operator.

I wished you'd drop it but obviously you won't. So...


_Annoyance_ that you'd make any conjecture at all about the incoming
contents of my SMSs, or be tactless enough to voice such. Even if they
didn't have anything to do with someone in whom you are still emotionally
vested, what fucking business of yours are they - None. So keep
yer trap shut. See also default setting for anyone who makes such an
uncalled-for conjecture: fuck off smartarse.

A little knowledge is a very dangerous thing. 

Say, d'ya go around now, reading random people's bod lang, then telling
these people what they're thinking... try it. Observe how their
configuration goes to one of "Fuck off, you're invading me" shortly before
they tell you to piss off, or thump you.

So you won't see her getting the shits at your persistent, loud scanning
of hers.

Yes. As well as helping you begin to read other people, it turns you into
a better liar, and also _convinces_ you of your own correctness when you
misread someone, who is acting the way they do for reasons of which you
may be unaware. Proceed at your extreme peril.



> Probably still crap, probably always will be, but at least I'm trying
> to pay attention now.

See: Pease, Alan: "Body language" . Well illustrated. 
If you are always going to be crap at this, then STOP NOW. 


> Lets see, to illustrate (please excuse personal comments):

DANGER: personal comments are NOT excused. You are calling me to
account for actions here for which I have absolutely no reason to be
accountable. If you are doing this solely to demonstrate expertise in a
newfound skill, or not, it is still FUCKING ANNOYING.

It's annoying generally. In this case it's specifically annoying because
you're still interested in Xiu, and have your antennas up information for
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HER, which now includes me. If you think my life
revolves around her, you are mistaken. An example of your broken reasoning
in this area might be, for example:

Guy observes: pred gets on motorbike, rides off.
Guy thinks: pred is off to shag Xiu.

Um, no. The two correlate, but not predictably. Voicing conjecture that
this is the case is *bloody annoying*. It's just not your call to make.


> You very deliberately kept phone always face down...


This one gets 8-10 in ths slam with no parole, doesn't it! I *usually*
keep it face down, not just when you're looking. If I don't care, it has a
50% probability of being face down *by accident* anyway. Most of the time,
gravity _kept_ fone incidentally face down on table automatically with no
deliberation from me. There it sat... but not always - you contradict
yourself with another observation below: yes, I also toyed with it in
various ways including non-face-down, specifically, rotating it around the
axis of its stub aerial. Now, if you even think of telling me that playing
with the fuckin' aerial means I'm gonna get laid, just shoot yerself,
you're beyond repair. I just wanted to deal with a pile o' messages, the
contents of which I had NO way of predicting. There is nothing
self-recriminatory about how the phone is arranged, unless you choose to
believe it.


> snatched back from Dad who picked it up,

I have NO idea why he decided to do that. He's been acting weird lately.
Like, why, on that specific arvo, did he decide to get _you_ to climb the
ladder and tie the strings, making an irrelevant adjustment to a broken
sunshade? 

See comments below re dad and my fone.


> animated complaint about how looking at other people's messages is
> dangerous...

Background context: Joss's hubby's been busted reading her emails on the
sly, serious shit has hit the fan. I toldja that in the fucking drain. I
gave you the critical piece of context for that comment, and you'd
forgotten it already. You weren't listening. You'd better be listening
now.


The following actions - looking at other people's mail, overhearing their
conversations - conjecturing on or looking at their smss - _annoys
people_. Get it into your head man. There's a reason cryptography is
popular. It's cos people DONT WANT THEIR MESSAGES READ or guessed by
random other people. Like YOU.


You've spent this week asking me personal questions about Xiu, and when I
give you personal details you get upset. You wish I didn't tell you that I
got her off - for good reason. You were not ready to know and I now know
you never would be. I shouldda kept that private. SOME MESSAGE CONTENT IS
NOT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES.


Suppose you or dad DID pick my fone up, trawl the messages, and read, 

"Thanks for a great shag, want another one? 934875934875923"


What would either of you think.... would you be right... it wouldn't
matter except that I'd be pissed off that you read this stuff without my
say-so.


I'm getting mixed messages from you, about, do you or do you not want to
know intimate details of my life. Maybe in private, yeah, OK. But don't
pry into mine. 

Use some fuckin' _tact_ man, if I figure out that you have a communicable
disease, I don't hear your phone ring and say, "I know who that was."
 

On that afternoon, you did this `I know who that was' stuff in front of my
_parents_, enquiries from whom I go to some effort to shield myself and
other people, 'cos it's none of their freakin' business either. Do they
want to know that you think I might be lining up to fuck yer ex? Probably
not.  But wether or not they do, _I_ DONT WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT COS IT'S
NOT THEIR BUSINESS.



And, come on, what is *anyone*, let alone my dad, doing with my phone
unless I specifically give it to them. _Theft_. This is not specific to
the exact message content relationship to you, it is about control of my
posession and its information. I don't just wander over and pick up
someone else's fone unless I ask for it first, or I am MrY and ah ah ah
don't have any fuckin' manners. That you can't see this is embarassing. 
Take someone's stuff without asking and they'll want it back. _Get_ it.


> the whole time you were fiddling with the phone (not something you
> normally do),

No. Much of the time it was face down on the desk, with keys. For almost
entire afternoon it was in shirt pocket. But then I hadn't turned it on,
and hadn't just got a load of beeps. I did get a load of beeps. Three
messages... now, this MIGHT be one person wanting to send me something,
but it might be three people, sending data cached on the cellfone network
for previous several hours. Maybe the cat serv has shat out again (Veridas
chopped us on Sunday the previous week).


> and generally looking eager to get alone with it to deal with messages...


D'ya think it might be that i just like to see what people send me, close
to when it arrives, before the data gets stale. They arrived close
together 'cos I'd only turned the fone on a couple of mins earlier. If I
am proximal spectator to a boring conversation I'd quite unsurprisingly go
look at the fuckin' messages. But there's another reason: I think it's
RUDE to pay attention to a fone when actual people are present in
proximal meatspace. Generally I'll try and excuse myself before I go look
at this stuff, unless I get bored or am feeling ignored/peripheral to
surrounding conversation. I'll get fidgetty torn between the two. 


> no answer to my comment "I know who that was".

This is tact on my part. My natural reaction would be to tell you to get fucked.
By ever saying anything like tha you're just exposing a lack of
consideration for other people's privacy.

WHAT POSSIBLE GOOD IS IT GOING TO DO WHEN YOU TELL ME YOU KNOW WHO THAT
WAS? If I said, no you don't, you'd repeat the claim, sure you're right,
not taking the hint that your being right does not fuckin' matter. If I
said, yes you do, how would this change what you were sure you knew
anyway? It's just pointless to answer, your correctness or lack of
notwithstanding.
 
Your fail rate on that was 66%. Nature is telling you something. Learn
from it.


> Your level of attention to the phone, and sense of eagerness to
> deal with it, and concern for privacy, said:

said, I wanted to deal with messages sent TO ME, and not to anyone else,
NOW, in private. That's ALL. Period.


>  - The messages related to your plans for that evening.

Wooo.... hey, guess what, it's mid-afternoon. I guess I'm not about to do
anything before the evening arrives, right?

Get a fucking algorithm which works, something like so:

:level of attention to fone is a function of alternative  boring adjacent
conversation (I've heard Ra's story several times, interesting in itself
but not several times, yeah?) vs possible important news from fone. Of
course I'm gonna be interested in stuff which comes to MY FONE.

Some of these deductions are just pointless. Why not say that they also
related to something that was possibly happening in Sydney, too, which
you could also deduce from the level of attention to the fone, my sense of
eagerness to deal with it, and concern for privacy, and the fact that I
was answering it in Sydney. Geeeenius!


>  - Which involved female(s), and probably possible sex.

A suggestion which implies to me you're not getting enough.
(see how annoying this sort of pointless conjecture is, now that I've
just made one about you... even if I'm right it does no good for me to
voice the claim.)

Astonishing predictive powers....notice that fifty percent of the fuckin'
population is females and they all have fones! Deduce from previous
conversations that I am sexually active. I don't fuck men, so the rest of
this sentence is implied. I answer my SMSs from men, too. Does this mean
I'm gonna get my arse slugged in the evening... um, no. 
 
Seeing as you evidently want to know, smartarse, the individual
concerned's name is Jodi. She didn't send any of the messages, but she did
ask me on friday night if I wanted a shag. No, you will never meet her.
You'd go trying this body lang probe stuff on her, just to see if you
could.


Dude... are you perhaps waking up to the fact that the contents of DYD CAN
TURN YOU INTO AN _INSUFFERABLE_ _ARSEHOLE_. No. Thought not. Never mind.


>  - You didn't want the details revealed to anyone there.
                                             ^^^^^^

Least of all you. Clue in! What's someone saying when they don't want to
reveal details: I DONT WANT YOU TO DEDUCE THEM OR REVEAL THEM EITHER,
dickhead! There's reasons I didn't want the details revealed. PAY FUCKING
ATTENTION TO THAT FACT.



> All of which carried high 'Xiu-factor' (given background knowledge),
> and your reaction to my 'I bet..' comment absolutely confirmed her
> involvement.

Well, hooray. You figured out that I might have a shag lined up for the
evening, that's just fuckin' great. Why not give up electrical engineering
and become a cop. Or a court prosecutor. Fuck off, man, it's not your
fucking business. 

 
> One thing that I didn't read was that the calls were different
> people. But I think that would be an impossible thing to spot.

NO, FUCKHEAD! YOU'D JUST HAVE TO SAY, "I know who that was" again, twice.
And then run the whole list of claims above past me again. WHY GO LOOKING
INTO ASPECTS OF MY LIFE THAT I DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT! It's just
gonna PISS ME OFF!


> Although, I suspect that a woman who knew you, if she was present,

And good for her. I doubt a chick'd ever be so stupid as to open her mouth
about it.

DO NOT ENTER. CONTACT WITH THESE WIRES WILL CAUSE DEATH.

Fucked if I'm gonna be anywhere near my 'phone while you're around. Maybe,
given your newfound "I'll tell you what you're thinking"  powers, I might
just avoid you entirely.

> Thats good, cos its not important.

BZZZZZZZZT! YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION!

It is that _you don't believe you made a mistake_ about thinking I was
feeling guilty, which is important. You misread me. I am not feeling
guilty, I simply resented being probed. 


If people are starting to tell you you're wrong more often than you think
you're wrong, it's probably because you're wrong more often than you think
you are wrong. 

LISTEN: you're wrong more often than you think you are.

Oh, seriously, if it shits me I'll just smash it with fungicides. To which
it will be totally unadapted due to living a cushy life in my feet all
these years. 

I am asking you the question, but did not expect an answer. It was one of
those questions which is asked, as if to say, it's none of your business
what's growing on my feet.

I reveal a lot of stuff in the gutful/hunting documents, but that's all I
am prepared to reveal, sometimes I just don't want to be further
interrogated.

Dude, if what you said in the drain was right, you're interrogating her by
proxy and it's shitting her. Given the phone/body lang episode yesterday
I'm starting to think you can't help it.
