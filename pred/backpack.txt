Yeah! EXCELLENT idea!

Lots, but of course my pack would be better.

31 by the time it goes to print, I guess.

> - How Long Have You Had This Back Pack?

Since 1991. It's been to India, Nepal, Singapore, dragged through a bunch
of drains in most of the capital cities of Australia. Has motorbiked from
Melb to Cooktown, was dragged up to the top of Mt Arapiles, and also to
the top of the Three Sisters.

At, of all places, K-Mart. I think my mum paid for it for my 20th
birthday. Its first outing was to the Kowmung Valley for a caving
expedition, May 24th, 1992. "Jackeroo" brand. Probably the best
fifty bucks expenditure on pack equipment she ever made. Colour scheme is
blue red and grey, would be better as camouflaged pack, but IMHO is better
than the standard army pack. Can fix this with paint, I guess.

At the moment: 
A Pentium 900MHz in a 3-bay tower case. Will replace a server in 1 hour.
A copy of "Feynman's Lectures on Computation" wrapped in plastic bag...
taking it to new residence.
A few self-tapping Philips-head screws (loose).
I used to carry a Swiss Army knife but they've been banned, sucks!
One hacksaw blade (found yesterday)
2 Condoms (steel-belted cross-ply; I rotate them, can't be too careful, heh)
Petzl head torch.
A large, thick-walled garbage bag (can waterproof loads inside it).
Pozidrive screwdriver, slot screwdriver, long-nose pliers.
There are some redundant snap-locks to replace existing ones when they 
eventually break.


> - What's on your Backpack?

A BlackDiamond karabiner. 
A D-shackle.
Condemned climbing ropes (used for roping on heavy/bulky objects) 
Vertical aluminium inner frame straps, and lower partition have been removed.

> - Anything else/stories/confessions about your back pack?

This backpack replaces the one I got in 1989, which wore out irreversibly
due to nylon fabric unravelling. It fits me better than the old one and
distributes weight on my hips as well as shoulders. I can find my way
around it in total darkness. I have considered acquiring another one like
it but I figure all the reinforcing/mods would just have to be done again.
I also considered waterproofing treatment but this apparently doesn't work
well on nylon.

Has been used to carry parent's dog on motorbike (and she loves it).
Was fucked upon in a Condell Park woodshed in 1996 (bloodstains now gone).
Has undergone severe structural enforcement at load-bearing points: tears
    have been sewn up with 2mm diameter copper wire, then soldered down.
Is washed periodically and *always* turns the wash water ultra-black.

Maximum loads: 
internal: a 20kg bag of sand/cement
external: roped on, small domestic (100L capacity) hot-water heater.
          roped on, 17-inch computer monitor (mini-tower inside).

Most dangerous load: a 2L bottle of thorium nitrate solution + shielding
Most fragile load: borosilicate glassware salvaged from abandoned factory
Most flammable load: 20L jerrycan of unleaded petrol

          
Fits: a mini-tower case, a slab of beer, my CRO, parent's dog (not all at once)

That'd be good, since I don't have a functional camera at the mo. I live
in Leichardt.

Burgatron hates me! I saw a sticker which said so...

Cool idea guys!

Ask diode about his maximum-pack stuffing technique. He has some very
historic packs, including ones owned by his dad and granddad, famous
Australian conservationists.
