:-) Better not quote Diode on matters of paranoia; everyone knows
Diode is a paranoid looney. Especially when you have just been
calling him such names yourself.
But people might like to offer Predator a beer or two and ask him
about his experiences.

Hmm thats not exactly what I said. Which was- that CC is monitored
to some extent, by ASIO. And there are the capabilities to place
targetted phonetaps with ease, and also to search most (they sift
about 80%) of electronic coms for keywords and phrases. This is
direct from people I've spoken to that are directly involved in
doing such monitoring.

But Pred's story is more entertaining.

Anyway, its all a question of whether they have pricked up their ears
on this one yet, or will.

Hmm, terrorism - a bit far fetched. But it is (was) national infrastructure,
so yeah, I guess.

You see, I'm sure you can eventually get over this worry with M.
Already you are much less dramatic about the risk. Previously
it was 'three times he's attacked people and had to be pulled off,
when triggered by a loud noise' - or something like that.
Now its one assault (sorely provoked), and a self-injury (also
rather 'provoked'.)
At this rate, you should be quite happy with him in about a month?

Anyway, life's always risky, and never predictable.
Maybe if you go on a mine expo with M, a rock will fall on your
head and M. will be the hero who carries you out.
