Subject: News?

How are things in your corner of the world? Are you up to anything exciting?

Life is great here, still with lovely soccer boy. Think I'm starting to get
all clucky and want to settle down!!! We're trying to buy a house in
Bangalow, but so far no luck. House prices here are as bad as Sydney!

God, don't I sound boring!

Start playing summer soccer in 2 weeks time. 6 a side, half the field, not
so hard, although there is still a lot of running.

What else is happening? Been a bit hectic, had Isha (my housemate) mum here
for 2 weeks, she's gone now and all can go back to normal, winter soccer
grand finals are all done now, all 3 Bangalow teams lost :-(. Work is work,
we have a green tree frog making it's home in our garden which is cute!

Not much else.. Anything from you? How's uni and the rest of your life?

Wow, so they're going to pay you to do that interesting thesis we talked

and boring? you're not so old.. and not someone I would call boring!

Yeah, but.... well, I suppose it's not that bad, we;ve got the deposit, but
if I want to have babies in the next few years, then we need to have more
money saved so that I don't have to work immediately. Such forward planning!

Might come to Sydney in January, if you're around perhaps we can find
something to do. I'll let you know the plans later on.

I have a large neoplasm growing where my left kidney used to be. Fuck

Dude,

Can't tell you how sad I am to have heard that news. Never imagined that
you'd be in this position - not htat I've spent any time thinking about it
at all.

So, give it to me straight - how sick are you really? I did some research of
my own and my findings indicate that you may be sicker than you admit in
these writings.

Glad to hear that you've decided to try the immune therapy though, or the
DNA one. Thigns change a lot in a few years with research, hopefully yoiu'll
be all fine and back in drains asap. There's thousands of people who beat
cancer, and who live  fulfilled lives, without being sick, this will most
probably be you. YOu know what though? YOu're not sick right now, nad you
have a whole lot of treatment options and some good doctors to help you
along, and just becuase the horrible cancer has spread, doesn't mean you
will definitely die from it. All it means is that even though we all die,
you just might have a clearer indiction of what might bring you undone one
day.. and it might never happen.

There's a whole pool of thoughts swimming though my head about how *I* feel
about *you* having cancer that's in your lymphs, but it's completely
irrelevant, except to say that it completely sucks, and if you die, I;ll
really miss you (so don't die!)

How are you coping? Have you dissolved into teary mess yet (not that I think
you will, but if you did, it would be OK too). Have you received any more
answers from the cancer guru's you were see as you said in your ramblings
the other day?

Well, it's taken me days to write this and it's not even very long or very
meaningful, but hope you understand that I'm v glad to have such a great
friend as you, and if you need anythign at all, let me know. Feel slightly
useless at the moment, and was thinking how could I make this better for
Pred? No way came to mind, except for not buying a house and sending you the
$$ to go o/s and get treatment.. However, as with most things chucking money
at it and hoping it goes away doesn't work..  And after all that I thought
I'd just remind you that if you need help/chat whatever, you know where to
find me.

So, in all, I'm sad, and I cried and I got cranky and I got scared, but it's
not about me  - it's about you. I'm scared for you, but have this feeling
you will be OK and that you'll beat the cancer. Think maybe I'm sad and
concerned because I like ya (you should already know that!!)!

I thought aobut your situation a lot, and I remember going through the same
when mum was sick, and how I decided that cancer is an insidious, ugly
beast. Laast night I drew some parallels between your situation  and mums
and how neither of you deserve to have anything remotely bad happen, and
that it's not 'fair'. But, then not much  is 'fair or just'... I don't konw.
Am a little awkward and lost for words.. and probably not making you feel
any better...

But, you'll have to *really* be a predator now, seek and slay the cancer
within! You have a chance.

Anyway, loveya, call me if you wanna sometime sometimes it;s easier than
emailing.... 6687 2676
Tell me how you're doing and all the details of whatever treatment you
decide on etc etc.

Kath xx

None of us think about it until we're dropped in it.

The five-year survivability rate for excised RCC metastatic carcinoma is
about 80%, but of course you don't know if you're in the 80% that live, or
the 20% that die.

The thing is, even if Im free of this one, I am now aware of the
possibility of a generalised susceptibility to the process. I don't know
if I'm genetically predisposed or not.

But there's no way to know until the race is run, is there? 8-)

It is probable that if something else doesn't get me first, this disease
process will. The longer I outlast it, the greater that probability
becomes. But there's no way to know. Statistics has uncertainty in it, and
that's the shit.

Yeah, I know.

Fuck... dude. I'm not all that keen on being dead for a variety of
reasons. But if I decide to take myself off the coil, I'll do it. I'll say
goodbye first, tho.

Nothing I didn't know already. I feel sort of neutral about it.

The best thing is, relax. PArt of what makes it hard is watching everyone

Yeah. I don't see this as something *I* have to fight, it's something I
just have to train my immunology to fight for me. That's why it's there.

Well, yeah, though it's a natural failure mode intrinsic to being a
complex multicellular differentiated organism. Cut me and I heal up - if I
wasn't equipped with cell growth control genes I couldn't do that without
growing a tumor every time I got a cut anywhere. Most of the time these
control genes work well. They're worth the risk.

Relax dude. Yeah, the universe doesn't give a shit, stuff isn't fair. But
once we know that, and accept it, then we can deal with it.

Subject: Some things at work amuse me..

I just reviewed the security tape of our server room, and found the most
hideously funny things...

We have a couple of citrix servers which are unreliable and need to be
rebooted, often earlier in the morning than when I start work. We have
trained a couple of the early birds to enter the server room, turn on the
monitor and use the monitor switch to go between Citrix servers, in order to
find the one to reboot, and to reboot it.

I have been unable to stop myself from lauging and almost gagging at the
funny things they do in there.. There is a sticker on the monitor switch
that says 'please remove before use'. It was a sticker that was probably on
the cardboard packing that came with the monitor switch, and got put onto
the monitor switch. This morning, I saw the receptionist tip toe into the
server room, look around sheepishly, remove the 'please remove before use'
sticker from the switch, use it, then replace the sticker - all nicely stuck
down as it was before!

At least there are still things at work to make me laugh!

Fascist mother has gone back to Sydney, back to Dad who, last week while I
was there let the bomb drop that he has 2 other kids to another woman (who
was his wife before mum) whom he had divorced 10 years after he and mum were
married, which of course means that he and ma are not legally married, which
of course provides mum with a 'legitimite' whinge and poor me scene that she
can perpetuate for hte rest of her life.... ho hum.

Who said there's anything wrong with white trailer park trash!? Oh, did I
forget to mention Dad;s dad had an affair with this woman (Irene) and dad
left her. HOwever, dad's dad - Norm, ended up marryign Irene and having a
whole swarm of other children...

mum says she never knew about any of it, dad says that Irene came to visit
mum when I was a baby, and told her the story. Mum, it appears didn't get
enough mileage (attention) out of her cancer, or either got so used to it
that she;s not gunna use this one to win her more - or extend the length of
the attention.

She tried some hystrionics with me while she was 'helping me move', tears,
drama the whole ensemble, to which my response was along the lines of have
you decided what you're gonna do?
Mum: No
Kath: you'd better treat dad a lot more nicely than you currently are while
you're deciding
mum: why, I can't trust him
kath: because if you don't, and if you decide to stay with him, andyou
continue treating him  badly, then you'll get back to Sydney and he'll have
chnaged his mind and you'll be fucked.
mum: (tears and sobbing)

It's like watchign a rerun of home and away.

I read the last 2 parts in your file. Looks good that Bill has shrunk. Still
not good that you're sick. Maybe it wasn't a tumor and you'll be OK!?

AAAAAh! GAAAACK! Now, this chick should get an extra $5k a year for
getting around a stupid sticker in such a way as is unlikely to upset
anyone. Um, how did she nicely stick down the sticker without setting off
the switch again, is what I want to know, because that would clearly be a
contravention of the Remove Before Use rule. Arrrfuckin funny.

Kath says to mum, do the math mum.

I've never watched it but if that's true I will avoid watching it if
possible!

It was, it just never got off the ground, so to speak. Must have died of
tim-tam poisoning (tho we dont really know if it has died). Pass the
tim-tams.

Subject: Hiyou

Morning,

I'm gonna miss you when you die. THis whole thing must suck much more for
you, because it';s happening to you...

You're this dude who I hardly ever see anymore whihc is cool since I'm lving
up here in the country and you're in the city, but it does suck that we
might never get to do the hangout/catch up thing again, and it just occurred
to me that I'd like to say hi and remind you ( or maybe jsut me) of some fun
stuff..... Remember that time I clung to your leg @ Nicks party? And the
time I went back to your house with you in Arncliffe and you know who rang
up in order to resuce me?!? And then there was that time at Gills place
where we gently fondled each other, but decided against shaggery, and the
time at my 18th b;day party where you slept under the lounge in the back
room of my fascisit parents house, or was it the shed? I can't quite remeber
anymore..Or the time we actually shagged in the dungeon or the time I
happily threw my arms around you at a Skeggs Boxing day party, and we walked
home together, only for me to stack drunkenly into your pumpkin bush, and
you called me a cab!!

I don't know hwat you must have thought of me as an 18 year old trapped,
afraid catholic, but somehow you clued me into the fact taht the barbed wire
fences of religion and the narrow halls of parental control are all
escapable, if you have the correct tools and have ht knowledge to be able to
apply the tool to the job. Somehow, you were able to provide me with those
tools to haul myself up over the edge and over into the vieled field of
freedom and for that I can never thak you enough, I Guess the best thanks
would be for me to be able to teach someone else these same tips and tricks.

I've got 10 years worth of conversatoin stored up in my inbox here, and I'm
gonna keep every one of them... I wish this wasn't happening to you, I wish
that you'd be still draining in 100 years time, but spose not every wish can
come true. I chose today to write this email to ya, because I sorta thought
you might choose tomorrow as a significant day to leave. Either way, I hope
you have a good day tomorrow.

I know youre not dead yet ( i hope) sorry, got a bit emotional and weird...
anyway... dunno what to say.. so..

xxxx
Ps please can you not put this in your internet blogs!!
