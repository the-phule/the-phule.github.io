Subject: [Catgeek] PROPOSAL:: upgrade conway to Redhat

Please note: this list is archived and searchable via the web.

I know that conway used to be Redhat back in the early days.

I want to put forward a proposal to move back to Redhat.

Plus:
    1. Widely available information about Redhat compared with Debian. 
The large amount of information, with the well known brand name would be 
a help with encouraging non geeks.  Debian is good if your 'in the 
know', but more difficult to find information on than Redhat.
    2.  The upgrade could happen as a 'new install' and migrate. This 
would allow creating of full documentation of all the required services. 
Verify the integreity of the system before starting, and allow 
installation of intrusion detection systems. I know that Conway was 
compromised in the past, and while that security hole was closed, we 
cannot be 100% sure that there other security holes as a result of this 
compromise.
    3.  I heard comments about 'RPM hell' and Redhat not having 
'apt-get'. Well perhaps in the past Redhat did not. It does now.  'rpm 
can act as an FTP and/or HTTP client so that  packages  can  be  
queried  or installed from the internet.  Package  files for install, 
upgrade, and query  operations  may  be  specified as an ftp or http 
style'.  
  4. The Redhat Package Manager (rpm) support verification and integrety 
checking of the installed packages. This is very useful - you can check 
that the executable on the file system is what came out of the package 
-ie it has not been motified.

 Down:
    1. Small learning curve for people who are familiar and 'used to' 
the debian system. (No getting away from this - each build has slight 
differences. Not major, but small enough to be annoying when your used 
to working with one distro for any lenght of time).


Other items that I don't think count as plus or down,

1. Redhat has much improved installation procedure  than Debian - (not 
that installation happens alot, but Redhat has a lot better driver 
support - detection and and configuration of ).
2. Redhat is more current.


Anyway. This is a proposal. Lets hear what people think?

Btw. I am putting my time in for doing the upgrade to Redhat. (including 
the documentation). The idea being to do this install on another box, 
check for any migration issues, script the move, so that downtime for 
conway would be keept to a minimium.
