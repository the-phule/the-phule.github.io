In some ways. But it is sort of OK in that I do have some say in the
experimental design. Like when to call it all off. Not a lot of rattus
norvegicus get that privelage.

Dude. On a somewhat more macabre note, I think it'd be a waste of a
perfectly good carcass if I were converted to air pollution or stashed in
landfill. I can't donate me organs 'cos they'll have cryptic mets in them
by now. So, who do I ask about bequeathing my bod to say, the anatomy
department?
