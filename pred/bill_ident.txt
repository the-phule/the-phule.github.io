"The aspirate is cellular and consists of numerous malignant cells in a 
 predominantly dispersed pattern and some poorly cohesive sheets. The
 cells have eccentrically placed nuclei with irregular nuclei,
 hyperchromatic granular chromatin, multiple macronucleoli and a moderate
 amount of finely vacuolated cytoplasm. Mitoses and abundant necroses are
 also noted. The appearances are those of a metastatic high-grade
 carcinoma with features favouring a renal primary.
 
 Did the patient have clear cell renal carcinoma and was if Fuhrmann grade 4?

(yes, actually, but I think I told them that)

 Malignant cells in the sections of the cell block are positive for
 cytokeratins (Cam 5.2 and AE1/AE3) and vimentin. This supports the
 diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma."
