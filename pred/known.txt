         * Tunnel: When the seas dry up, or scuba when sea VERY still. Can
         squeeze thru grille at sea exit, or thru cyclone fence gap and
         drop 4m into room behind grille. Tunnel entrance under water.
         * Side room: via large 7' x 5' grille, on W side of main sea exit.
         Need crowbar to lift and slide it along. Ladder down into room.
         Underwater tunnel 20m long joins to main sea exit, where there is
         an underwater wooden grille. Inside room is 2nd massive steel
         grille, no access, don't know where room on other side goes.
Care:    DO NOT risk being sucked into tunnel by surges from swell. If you
         lift shaft covers, MUST replace, or you'll kill someone, as
         falling in is certain death. Covers are rectangular, concrete,
         takes two people to lift. Beware dropping them in.
Wet:     Dive.
Cond:    All completely under water, even at lowest tide. Tunnel probably
         still in good condition for full length, but shaft at power
         station end filled with rubble.
Todo:    Lift manhole covers near power station end shaft.

History: * Construction was only monitored via word of mouth so if convicts
         got bored digging the main tunnel, they would start digging their
         own tunnel, thereby wasting the Civil Engineers time and money.
         * Reopened 03/08/02 by SCC. Proved to have toxic (CO2) atmosphere.

Name:    Chocolate Goldmine, The; 300m+
Other:   The Sump.
Descrip: Disused (?) sewer relief tunnel.
Feat:    Two disused (mostly) sewers. Access is via one of two deep shafts,
         one being nearly 80m deep, with balconies and ladders to the
         bottom, the other, also with balconies etc is around 50m deep. At
         the bottom of these shafts is a 6' RCP that leads to a large T
         shaped chamber, with ocean outlet tunnels to the E and the old
         main sewer tunnel running to the W. This tunnel is bowl shaped,
         9'h & leads to a tall vent shaft. Here it gets wetter and
         continues on straight a long way before reaching a second shaft
         with dodgy balconies and ladders. Beyond this the air gets gassy
         and the water dirty. Huge roaring sound ahead. The "T" chamber
         also has balconies and a vent shaft.
Suburb:  Malabar
Area:    Syd-SE
Acc:     Of the two shafts, the eastern one is safer and the tunnel below
         it more hospitable. Its located down the trail, E of where the old
         wind generator used to be. Follow the trail to a set of brick
         lean-to's, sitting near the cliff edge. W of these is old bunker
         building. There is a manhole in the bushes to the N of this. Use a
         crowbar and lever the manhole up, utilising the wedge shaped crack
         in its collar. The other shaft is higher and far more dodgy:
         Manhole is right next to the Anzac Rifle Range Bunker tower. The
         collar sticks out of the ground and is smashed, so it can be
         pushed aside to allow access. Follow trail at the E end of
         Fishermans Rd [Sw:338Q1, Grg:437K4].
Exit:    Its advisable to open both manholes, using one shaft as an
         emergency exit.
Care:    Ladders and balconies in W shaft are dodgy, as are piles of rubble
         everywhere. Ladders and balconies in E shaft are ok, however, the
         manhole rungs are rusty. Don't fall in water in chamber.

Descrip: This is in the drain list cos that's what it is, however, unless
         you are insane, you wouldn't dare enter the actual tunnel, which
         is above a 40m drop, 2' dia and spewing shit into the ocean.
Feat:    What makes it worthwhile, is how you get to it: you climb down
         steps cut into solid cliff face. These stop and become a bridge,
         made of drift wood and two telephone poles, that go, 15m over a
         40m drop onto rocks. The other side has a few more steps then a
         plank which leads to a ledge with a sewer viewing shaft and a drop
         shaft into the ocean.

         About 5ks in on the Joadja rd there is an umarked gate on the RHS.
         Very easily missed cos there are heaps of gates.
Care:    Whole site is now privately owned. Only the owner lives on this
         1800 acre site.
Eek!:    Getting into the site - Tours were put on hold cos of the
         instability of some of the structures.
History: Long and extensive. Originally a oil shale refinery built in the
         1860's. Main products were oil,wax and kerosene. The company that
         owned the site and managed the business went into liquidation in
         1905 and by 1915 was a ghost town. Close to 3000 people lived here
         and was totally self sufficient as travel to Mittagong was a 2 day
         trip. It was then sold up to a private investor and remained that
         way till 1992 when it went up for auction again who are now the
         current owners.
Todo:    Underneath the retorts of the refinery there are numerous 47 inch
         high tunnels made from brick that run the length of the refinery
         retorts. There are also some mines that are probably worth a look
         that the shale was dug from.

Name:    Northside Storage Tunnel, The; 16km
Descrip: Tunnel dug to collect wet weather sewage overflow between Manly
         and Gladesville, with a 3.7km tunnel running N to Castle Cove. The
         most impressive tunnel in Sydney!.
Feat:    Its F@!*kin huge! Only partially explored. The tunnel sizes
         average 6m in dia, with a huge 21m H chamber at the access tunnel
         junction at Tunks park. The tunnel then runs 9km as a huge round
         pipe with train tracks down its middle, to Manly Sewerage
         Treatment Plant. U/s of the junction there is the split with an 8m
         H tunnel running up to Scotts Ck in Castle Cove and a narrower
         tunnel running to Gladesville. The junction tunnel is around 9m W
         with a shallow canal in its middle. Unless its raining, this
         usually has a steady flow of groundwater, whereas the edges of the
         canal have a nice smelly layer of sewage sludge. The Access tunnel
         100m downhill to a huge pressure door. The door sits in a wall
         which has fresh air pumped through it. The access tunnel runs
         about 400m down to the storage tunnel with a couple of side
         tunnels, and a spoil chamber on the way. It even has glow in the
         dark signs telling you how far you are from Manly STP.

Wet:     Do not enter before, during, or 3 days after heavy rain.
Cond:    All sandstone bored, floods suddenly with sewage during heavy

Notes:   The layout suggests there should be four sets of tunnels, but only
         one set is now accessible. There is a story that the tunnels in
         this bridge connect up with very old convict built tunnels that go

Acc:     Go to the Nth end to the road which runs under the bridge between
         the abutments and the foreshore [UBD:236E1, Grg:1K2]. Start here
         at the slope of the W abutment. Take a running start and climb up
         this and scale the fence (beware of razor wire). You're now up in
         the lower trusswork. Take the lower arch on the right and ascend
         the stairs up to the middle of the black diagonal trusses. Now,
         take the stairs/arch on the (?) L, there is an enclosed shaft.
         Climb up the step irons inside of it. You come out to a platform
         with a light on it. A bit of minor gymnastics here involving the
         handrail sees you across to the stairs on the arch, which you
         climb until you get to the top. At the top, aside from a view
         which is probably worth $2200 (but is better free) is a little
         shed on motorised wheels which has paint stuff on it, and also
         many more initials and bits of graffiti than the government would
         like. Take some time exposures, and then head down before the
         sunrise.
Care:    * Beware exposure! Wear black clothing and use absolute minimum
         torch.
         * Do it after 2am when the lights go out in the trusswork.
         * The space between the abutment and the arch is occupied by the
         security office!
         * Do it on a warm summer night so your body gives less contrast to
         the rumoured-to-exist (but not proven) IR detectors.
         * $2200 fine if caught. Don't carry ID, give a false name etc.
Notes:   See "The Kursk" entry below for a better, easier way up the
         Coathanger. This is the OLD AND UNRELIABLE method for getting up

         open it. Once in, go directly left, to do otherwise may set of
         I.R. sup steps to gantry that leads along under footpath. Walk to
