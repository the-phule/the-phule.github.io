Subject: [Catgeek] Dial in with PPP works via diesel.

Please note: this list is archived and searchable via the web.



I'm dialled into diesel.cat.org.au at the moment. Dialin works and is
reasonably fast! You need to have an account on diesel.cat.org.au , and
configure your software to use PAP. Windoze should just work (given
the number , username and password). Linux - use pppconfig , and then use
pon and poff, or use wvdial. 

Geek details  below on how diesel.cat.org.au was setup. Three 
fixes were  required.

1. fixing /etc/ppp/options.ttyS0

dialing into diesel.cat.org.au was failing, so looking in the logs on
diesel discovered this:

/var/log/syslog:

Mar 14 00:14:53 diesel pppd[5019]: unknown host: (none)
Mar 14 00:15:37 diesel pppd[5031]: unknown host: (none)
Mar 14 00:16:20 diesel pppd[5032]: unknown host: (none)
Mar 14 17:51:57 diesel pppd[5829]: unknown host: (none)

searching google gave a link off the first page returned which
suggested looking at /etc/ppp/options.ttyS0

hence lookin on diesel /etc/ppp/options.ttyS0 gave
(none):dialinuser
192.168.121.1:192.168.121.225

missing # obv. -- IPs number dont start with "(none)"

the file is now changed to:
#(none):dialinuser
192.168.121.1:192.168.121.225

2. fixing /etc/ppp/pap-secrets

Loging into diesel, using my laptop and "pon CAT" (after configuring
with pppconfig) -- showed up (on my side)

So, "no PAP secret found for andy" ...

pppd checks /etc/ppp/pap-secrets first then checks the system user db
(/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow -- this is what the "login" option to pppd 
specifys - mgetty launches pppd with certain options configurable in
/etc/mgetty/login.config)

however, as default, pap-secrets looks like
# Every regular user can use PPP and has to use passwords from /etc/passwd
*       (none)       ""      *

reading man pppd -- first fields username, second field server name, third
field password. * is  a wildcard to match everything...

so , "(none)" had to be changed to "*" -- [ for incoming connections the
second field is the server name of the localhost , so it could be set to
"diesel" i suppose. ]

diesel's /etc/ppp/pap-secrets is now:

# Every regular user can use PPP and has to use passwords from /etc/passwd
*       *       ""      *


NOTE: for dialin to work, the user needs to have a ordinary unix account
(added with adduser)

3. Changes to the firewall script

the following lines needed to be changed to the /etc/firescript.sh to
route dialin traffic through the firewall

DIALIN_INTERFACE="ppp0"
iptables -A INPUT -p ALL -i $DIALIN_INTERFACE -s $GREEN_RANGE -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i $DIALIN_INTERFACE -j ACCEPT

then to make it stick and let ipac work properly..

/etc/firescript_down.sh
/etc/firescript.sh
fetchipac -S
/etc/init.d/ipac-ng restart



... I can browse websites, use ssh, etc ... everything so work. enjoy.

Sonia has setup transparent proxying with Squid so browsers dont need
configuring.
