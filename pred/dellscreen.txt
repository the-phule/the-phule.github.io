Heh, yeah, well I guess it could be worse. I'm driving it off a small VGA
monitor in the meantime, which is so much less convenient to carry around
8-)

I'll assume this is $US (not the south pacific peso, uh, Australian Dollar  
of my homeland!)

That's very kind.... an IMO for $100 in the currency you prefer, it will
very likely be. I lack credit cards of any kind - toooo tempting and the
interest rates are crippling if the credit is not quickly repaid.

Mark - could you please confirm if this is what you have available - if it
isn't then it probably won't work in my box, laptops being the tricky
customised fiddly items they are.

Inverter : Printed circuit 1-656-884-12 PS-29 (C) Dell 1994, 1995 
Screen : Sharp LM64C35P (on sticker on the back of the panel)

Also, if you'll pardon my gentle enquiry - is there any way to know if
these bits came out of a working machine, or not? That is, would there be
anything to indicate that if they came from a condemned machine, that this
machine was condemned for reasons other than a toasted display (eg: stuck
keyboard keys, dead power supply stage, unavailability of replacement
batteries, blah blah?) Then again, it might have just been given away
secondary to an upgrade, etc. It's not that I don't trust your honesty,
but it would be a nuisance for these things to come this far only for them
to not work when they arrived.
