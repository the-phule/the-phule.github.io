Yeah! Slavish rule-following by clueless droids, people jerking off in the

AAAAAh! GAAAACK! Now, this chick should get an extra $5k a year for
getting around a stupid sticker in such a way as is unlikely to upset
anyone. Um, how did she nicely stick down the sticker without setting off
the switch again, is what I want to know, because that would clearly be a
contravention of the Remove Before Use rule. Arrrfuckin funny.

Hey... how about:

Poor me (another drink, my schooner is empty). YEah, but think about it,
go dad! What a root rat! You have double the siblings you did before!

Hey - you and me can *both* now technically be members of Bastards Anonymous!

MArriage is a fuckin' state of mind. Fuck the paperwork, frankly.

I've never watched it but if that's true I will avoid watching it if
possible!

It was, it just never got off the ground, so to speak. Must have died of
tim-tam poisoning (tho we dont really know if it has died). Pass the
tim-tams.
