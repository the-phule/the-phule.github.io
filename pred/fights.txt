Subject: Fwd: a few words from a survivor

Hey dude,

I wrote to Jim about your situation and he has come back with the following. 
Whatever gripes I have with him, I think he's right about this.

Take whatever you like from it and discard the rest.

Dear Heart: He's doing exactly what I did. But he's not the doctor, and he
sure as hell isn't going to survive if he thinks sympathy will suffice. He's
doing what his manhood requires. He's being brave, stalwart, and resigned.
But that's not what's going on INSIDE. He doesn't know what it feels like to
REALLY fight. He's intellectualizing it because he has never been in a fight
for his life before. People who sympathize with him are like co-alcoholics.
He has to be confronted with the price of feeling sorry for himself. He'll
get angry when someone accuses him of it. But the reality is there, and
he'll try to rationalize why it makes sense, but he knows it doesn't. I
resented it when I was told and it was the anger at the relization of the
injustice of being attacked by a fucking disease when I had so much to live
for that got me through. I was told I had a 5% chance to live a year. He has
a lot better chance than I did. When he gets through it he'll have a burst
of energy like he's never known before. But he has to stop posing and ASK
FOR HELP. It's out there. Get him to a councilor, or doctor who knows what
the hell is going on. Don't trust the first few diagnosticians. Find the one
who thinks they can deal with it. And then find out what he would like to do
or accomplish that would make it worth the fight. I was hit just as I was
getting to design my own theatre building. That dream and students who loved
me came to my hospital room and got in bed with me to keep my fire going. If
he has no future in his head he'll submit. Cancer is NOT incurable no matter
how bleak it may look. Pessimism IS incurable. Don't feel you have to be
nice about it. He has to know there are people who will get angry with him
for dying, and depriving them of his presence in their lives. Me for one.
Dying young is not romantic. It's often just selfish. Like suicide. He's the
last one to know at this point because he's scared shitless, and he can't
cop to it. It's a guy thing. Needles, and knives, and puking your guts up
every day can wear you down, but he hasnt had to deal with that much yet.
It's panic that he's fighting now. He can't make it alone. He needs hope
that may come from a dream, great sex, love, adrenalin, whatever. Somebody
has to help him find it. Or the sympathizers who can't, even in their
wildest dreams, imagine where his head is, will help kill him. He has life
in his body that can get him through. Whatever it takes to kick start it can
save him. Otherwise the assholes of the world will survive and we'll lose
another rare personality. You can let him read this if you want, but
whatever you do, don't accept his panic diagnosis. It's bullshit. My love to
you both in a tough time of your lives. I wish I was there.       Brightwolf
