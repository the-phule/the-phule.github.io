<p>So back in the good old days of the dinosaurs, insert Calven and Hobbs picture here. I used to write html pages for websites in things called text editors, like emacs and vim, now these days you hire people to create websites. I still code in text editors:</p>

<p>This site is hosted on github.io if you want more information I suggest finding a manual and reading it. The whole thing was created by hand in the atom editor, with out any weird web2.foo strangness. And yes it's meant to be black writing on a white background, and to quote a greater man then I; "No I don't care what you think..."</p>
